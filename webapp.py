        - **Get Recommendations**: Once you've configured the system, you can get recommendations by pressing the 'generate recommendations' button at the bottom of the page.
        - **Categories & Subcategories**: You can customize your interests by selecting from a wide range of categories and subcategories, by default, the system will search based on your configured interests.
        - **Recommendation Count**: Choose how many recommendations you want to receive.
        - **Time Range**: Decide the time frame for the articles you're interested in.

        Whether you're a researcher, academic, or just someone interested in scientific literature,
        this service is built to cater to your specific needs.

        ### How It Works

        - **Configure**: The first step is to configure the system to your interests. This can be done by navigating to the configure page.
        - **Get Recommendations**: Once you've configured the system, you can generate recommendations by navigating to the get recommendations page.

        ### What Makes Us Different

        - **Personalized**: Recommendations are fine-tuned to match your unique academic interests.
        - **Up-to-Date**: The platform provides options to focus on the most recent articles.
        - **Quality Assured**: We prioritize recommendations from reputable sources and peer-reviewed journals.

        ### Mission Statement

        As an upcoming data scientist with a strong passion for deep learning, I am always looking for new technologies and methodologies. Naturally, I spend a considerable amount of time researching and reading new publications to accomplish this. However, over 14,000 academic papers are published every day on average, making it extremely tedious to continuously source papers relevant to my interests. My primary motivation for creating ScholarlyRecommender is to address this, creating a fully automated and personalized system that prepares a feed of academic papers relevant to me. This feed is prepared on demand, through a completely abstracted streamlit web interface, or sent directly to my email on a timed basis. This project was designed to be scalable and adaptable, and can be very easily adapted not only to your own interests, but become a fully automated, self improving newsletter. Details on how to use this system, the methods used for retrieval and ranking, along with future plans and features planned or in development currently are listed below.

        Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have received enormous attention
over the past year and are now used by hundreds of millions of people every
day. The rapid adoption of this technology naturally raises questions about the
possible biases such models might exhibit. In this work, we tested one of these
models (GPT-3) on a range of cognitive effects, which are systematic patterns
that are usually found in human cognitive tasks. We found that LLMs are indeed
prone to several human cognit...

        Large Language Models (LLMs) have made substantial progress in the past
several months, shattering state-of-the-art benchmarks in many domains. This
paper investigates LLMs' behavior with respect to gender stereotypes, a known
issue for prior models. We use a simple paradigm to test the presence of gender
bias, building on but differing from WinoBias, a commonly used gender bias
dataset, which is likely to be included in the training data of current LLMs.
We test four recently published LLMs and...

    <div class="abstract">
        Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
success. However, LVLMs are still plagued by the hallucination problem, which
limits the practicality in many scenarios. Hallucination refers to the
information of LVLMs' responses that does not exist in the visual input, which
poses potential risks of substantial consequences. There has been limited work
studying hallucination evaluation in LVLMs. In this paper, we propose
Hallucination Evaluation based on Large Language Mod...

    <div class="abstract">
        Generative models (foundation models) such as LLMs (large language models)
are having a large impact on multiple fields. In this work, we propose the use
of such models for business decision making. In particular, we combine
unstructured textual data sources (e.g., news data) with multiple foundation
models (namely, GPT4, transformer-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) models
and Entailment-based Zero-shot Classifiers (ZSC)) to derive IT (information
technology) artifacts in the form of a (sequ...

        Multi-modal large language models have garnered significant interest
recently. Though, most of the works focus on vision-language multi-modal models
providing strong capabilities in following vision-and-language instructions.
However, we claim that speech is also an important modality through which
humans interact with the world. Hence, it is crucial for a general-purpose
assistant to be able to follow multi-modal speech-and-language instructions. In
this work, we propose Large Language and Spee...

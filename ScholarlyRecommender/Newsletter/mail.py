"""
Example of how to configure the email server if you have installed ScholarlyRecommender
locally:
Replace the constants with your own email address, password, port number and
subscribers (delivery address).
Note that you need to enable less secure apps in your google account settings,
otherwise this will not work.
Once you have your own constants working, you can delete the input() calls and replace
them with your own constants.
To send an email, simply call send_email(content=html_string) from the Newsletter
module. html_string is the return value from the get_feed() function in feed.py.

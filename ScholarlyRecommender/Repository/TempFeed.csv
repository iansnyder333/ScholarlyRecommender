2308.15930v1,cs.CL,LLaSM: Large Language and Speech Model,2023-08-30 10:12:39+00:00,"Multi-modal large language models have garnered significant interest
recently. Though, most of the works focus on vision-language multi-modal models
providing strong capabilities in following vision-and-language instructions.
However, we claim that speech is also an important modality through which
humans interact with the world. Hence, it is crucial for a general-purpose
assistant to be able to follow multi-modal speech-and-language instructions. In
this work, we propose Large Language and Speech Model (LLaSM). LLaSM is an
end-to-end trained large multi-modal speech-language model with cross-modal
conversational abilities, capable of following speech-and-language
instructions. Our early experiments show that LLaSM demonstrates a more
convenient and natural way for humans to interact with artificial intelligence.
Specifically, we also release a large Speech Instruction Following dataset
LLaSM-Audio-Instructions. Code and demo are available at
https://github.com/LinkSoul-AI/LLaSM and
https://huggingface.co/spaces/LinkSoul/LLaSM. The LLaSM-Audio-Instructions
dataset is available at

2308.16361v1,cs.AI,Large Language Models as Data Preprocessors,2023-08-30 23:28:43+00:00,"Large Language Models (LLMs), typified by OpenAI's GPT series and Meta's
LLaMA variants, have marked a significant advancement in artificial
intelligence. Trained on vast amounts of text data, LLMs are capable of
understanding and generating human-like text across a diverse range of topics.
This study expands on the applications of LLMs, exploring their potential in
data preprocessing, a critical stage in data mining and analytics applications.
We delve into the applicability of state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-3.5,
GPT-4, and Vicuna-13B for error detection, data imputation, schema matching,
and entity matching tasks. Alongside showcasing the inherent capabilities of
LLMs, we highlight their limitations, particularly in terms of computational
expense and inefficiency. We propose an LLM-based framework for data
preprocessing, which integrates cutting-edge prompt engineering techniques,
coupled with traditional methods like contextualization and feature selection,
to improve the performance and efficiency of these models. The effectiveness of
LLMs in data preprocessing is evaluated through an experimental study spanning
12 datasets. GPT-4 emerged as a standout, achieving 100\% accuracy or F1 score
on 4 datasets, suggesting LLMs' immense potential in these tasks. Despite
certain limitations, our study underscores the promise of LLMs in this domain
and anticipates future developments to overcome current hurdles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16361v1,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Haochen Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yuyang Dong'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chuan Xiao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Masafumi Oyamada')]"
2308.15812v1,cs.LG,Peering Through Preferences: Unraveling Feedback Acquisition for Aligning Large Language Models,2023-08-30 07:35:32+00:00,"Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and intents
critically involves the use of human or AI feedback. While dense feedback
annotations are expensive to acquire and integrate, sparse feedback presents a
structural design choice between ratings (e.g., score Response A on a scale of
1-7) and rankings (e.g., is Response A better than Response B?). In this work,
we analyze the effect of this design choice for the alignment and evaluation of
LLMs. We uncover an inconsistency problem wherein the preferences inferred from
ratings and rankings significantly disagree 60% for both human and AI
annotators. Our subsequent analysis identifies various facets of annotator
biases that explain this phenomena, such as human annotators would rate denser
responses higher while preferring accuracy during pairwise judgments. To our
surprise, we also observe that the choice of feedback protocol also has a
significant effect on the evaluation of aligned LLMs. In particular, we find
that LLMs that leverage rankings data for alignment (say model X) are preferred
over those that leverage ratings data (say model Y), with a rank-based
evaluation protocol (is X/Y's response better than reference response?) but not
with a rating-based evaluation protocol (score Rank X/Y's response on a scale
of 1-7). Our findings thus shed light on critical gaps in methods for
evaluating the real-world utility of language models and their strong
dependence on the feedback protocol used for alignment. Our code and data are
available at https://github.com/Hritikbansal/sparse_feedback.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15812v1,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Hritik Bansal'), arxiv.Result.Author('John Dang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Aditya Grover')]"
2308.16137v1,cs.CL,LM-Infinite: Simple On-the-Fly Length Generalization for Large Language Models,2023-08-30 16:47:51+00:00,"In recent years, there have been remarkable advancements in the performance
of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. As
these LLMs are deployed for increasingly complex tasks, they often face the
needs to conduct longer reasoning processes or understanding larger contexts.
In these situations, the length generalization failure of LLMs on long
sequences become more prominent. Most pre-training schemes truncate training
sequences to a fixed length (such as 2048 for LLaMa). LLMs often struggle to
generate fluent texts, let alone carry out downstream tasks, after longer
contexts, even with relative positional encoding which is designed to cope with
this problem. Common solutions such as finetuning on longer corpora often
involves daunting hardware and time costs and requires careful training process
design. To more efficiently leverage the generation capacity of existing LLMs,
we theoretically and empirically investigate the main out-of-distribution (OOD)
factors contributing to this problem. Inspired by this diagnosis, we propose a
simple yet effective solution for on-the-fly length generalization,
LM-Infinite, which involves only a $\Lambda$-shaped attention mask and a
distance limit while requiring no parameter updates or learning. We find it
applicable to a variety of LLMs using relative-position encoding methods.
LM-Infinite is computational efficient with $O(n)$ time and space, and
demonstrates consistent fluency and generation quality to as long as 32k tokens
on ArXiv and OpenWebText2 datasets, with 2.72x decoding speedup. On downstream
task such as passkey retrieval, it continues to work on inputs much longer than
training lengths where vanilla models fail immediately.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16137v1,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Chi Han'), arxiv.Result.Author('Qifan Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Wenhan Xiong'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yu Chen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Heng Ji'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sinong Wang')]"
2308.16890v1,cs.CV,TouchStone: Evaluating Vision-Language Models by Language Models,2023-08-31 17:52:04+00:00,"Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently witnessed rapid
advancements, exhibiting a remarkable capacity for perceiving, understanding,
and processing visual information by connecting visual receptor with large
language models (LLMs). However, current assessments mainly focus on
recognizing and reasoning abilities, lacking direct evaluation of
conversational skills and neglecting visual storytelling abilities. In this
paper, we propose an evaluation method that uses strong LLMs as judges to
comprehensively evaluate the various abilities of LVLMs. Firstly, we construct
a comprehensive visual dialogue dataset TouchStone, consisting of open-world
images and questions, covering five major categories of abilities and 27
subtasks. This dataset not only covers fundamental recognition and
comprehension but also extends to literary creation. Secondly, by integrating
detailed image annotations we effectively transform the multimodal input
content into a form understandable by LLMs. This enables us to employ advanced
LLMs for directly evaluating the quality of the multimodal dialogue without
requiring human intervention. Through validation, we demonstrate that powerful
LVLMs, such as GPT-4, can effectively score dialogue quality by leveraging
their textual capabilities alone, aligning with human preferences. We hope our
work can serve as a touchstone for LVLMs' evaluation and pave the way for
building stronger LVLMs. The evaluation code is available at

success. However, LVLMs are still plagued by the hallucination problem, which
limits the practicality in many scenarios. Hallucination refers to the
information of LVLMs' responses that does not exist in the visual input, which
poses potential risks of substantial consequences. There has been limited work
studying hallucination evaluation in LVLMs. In this paper, we propose
Hallucination Evaluation based on Large Language Models (HaELM), an LLM-based
hallucination evaluation framework. HaELM achieves an approximate 95%
performance comparable to ChatGPT and has additional advantages including low
cost, reproducibility, privacy preservation and local deployment. Leveraging
the HaELM, we evaluate the hallucination in current LVLMs. Furthermore, we
analyze the factors contributing to hallucination in LVLMs and offer helpful
suggestions to mitigate the hallucination problem. Our training data and human
annotation hallucination data will be made public soon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15126v1,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Junyang Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yiyang Zhou'), arxiv.Result.Author('Guohai Xu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Pengcheng Shi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chenlin Zhao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Haiyang Xu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Qinghao Ye'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ming Yan'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ji Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jihua Zhu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jitao Sang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Haoyu Tang')]"
2308.16692v1,cs.CL,SpeechTokenizer: Unified Speech Tokenizer for Speech Large Language Models,2023-08-31 12:53:09+00:00,"Current speech large language models build upon discrete speech
representations, which can be categorized into semantic tokens and acoustic
tokens. However, existing speech tokens are not specifically designed for
speech language modeling. To assess the suitability of speech tokens for
building speech language models, we established the first benchmark,
SLMTokBench. Our results indicate that neither semantic nor acoustic tokens are
ideal for this purpose. Therefore, we propose SpeechTokenizer, a unified speech
tokenizer for speech large language models. SpeechTokenizer adopts the
Encoder-Decoder architecture with residual vector quantization (RVQ). Unifying
semantic and acoustic tokens, SpeechTokenizer disentangles different aspects of
speech information hierarchically across different RVQ layers. Furthermore, We
construct a Unified Speech Language Model (USLM) leveraging SpeechTokenizer.
Experiments show that SpeechTokenizer performs comparably to EnCodec in speech
reconstruction and demonstrates strong performance on the SLMTokBench
benchmark. Also, USLM outperforms VALL-E in zero-shot Text-to-Speech tasks.

2308.15930v1,cs.CL,LLaSM: Large Language and Speech Model,2023-08-30 10:12:39+00:00,"Multi-modal large language models have garnered significant interest
recently. Though, most of the works focus on vision-language multi-modal models
providing strong capabilities in following vision-and-language instructions.
However, we claim that speech is also an important modality through which
humans interact with the world. Hence, it is crucial for a general-purpose
assistant to be able to follow multi-modal speech-and-language instructions. In
this work, we propose Large Language and Speech Model (LLaSM). LLaSM is an
end-to-end trained large multi-modal speech-language model with cross-modal
conversational abilities, capable of following speech-and-language
instructions. Our early experiments show that LLaSM demonstrates a more
convenient and natural way for humans to interact with artificial intelligence.
Specifically, we also release a large Speech Instruction Following dataset
LLaSM-Audio-Instructions. Code and demo are available at

2308.16361v1,cs.AI,Large Language Models as Data Preprocessors,2023-08-30 23:28:43+00:00,"Large Language Models (LLMs), typified by OpenAI's GPT series and Meta's
LLaMA variants, have marked a significant advancement in artificial
intelligence. Trained on vast amounts of text data, LLMs are capable of
understanding and generating human-like text across a diverse range of topics.
This study expands on the applications of LLMs, exploring their potential in
data preprocessing, a critical stage in data mining and analytics applications.
We delve into the applicability of state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-3.5,
GPT-4, and Vicuna-13B for error detection, data imputation, schema matching,
and entity matching tasks. Alongside showcasing the inherent capabilities of
LLMs, we highlight their limitations, particularly in terms of computational
expense and inefficiency. We propose an LLM-based framework for data
preprocessing, which integrates cutting-edge prompt engineering techniques,
coupled with traditional methods like contextualization and feature selection,
to improve the performance and efficiency of these models. The effectiveness of
LLMs in data preprocessing is evaluated through an experimental study spanning
12 datasets. GPT-4 emerged as a standout, achieving 100\% accuracy or F1 score
on 4 datasets, suggesting LLMs' immense potential in these tasks. Despite
certain limitations, our study underscores the promise of LLMs in this domain
and anticipates future developments to overcome current hurdles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16361v1,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Haochen Zhang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yuyang Dong'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chuan Xiao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Masafumi Oyamada')]"
2308.15022v1,cs.CL,Recursively Summarizing Enables Long-Term Dialogue Memory in Large Language Models,2023-08-29 04:59:53+00:00,"Most open-domain dialogue systems suffer from forgetting important
information, especially in a long-term conversation. Existing works usually
train the specific retriever or summarizer to obtain key information from the
past, which is time-consuming and highly depends on the quality of labeled
data. To alleviate this problem, we propose to recursively generate summaries/
memory using large language models (LLMs) to enhance long-term memory ability.
Specifically, our method first stimulates LLMs to memorize small dialogue
contexts and then recursively produce new memory using previous memory and
following contexts. Finally, the LLM can easily generate a highly consistent
response with the help of the latest memory. We evaluate our method using
ChatGPT and text-davinci-003, and the experiments on the widely-used public
dataset show that our method can generate more consistent responses in a
long-context conversation. Notably, our method is a potential solution to
enable the LLM to model the extremely long context. Code and scripts will be
released later.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15022v1,"[arxiv.Result.Author('Qingyue Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Liang Ding'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yanan Cao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Zhiliang Tian'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shi Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dacheng Tao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Li Guo')]"

2212.09410v1,cs.CL,Less is More: Parameter-Free Text Classification with Gzip,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are often used for text classification tasks as
they usually achieve high levels of accuracy. However, DNNs can be
computationally intensive with billions of parameters and large amounts of
labeled data, which can make them expensive to use, to optimize and to transfer
to out-of-distribution (OOD) cases in practice. In this paper, we propose a
non-parametric alternative to DNNs that's easy, light-weight and universal in
text classification: a combination of a simple compressor like gzip with a
$k$-nearest-neighbor classifier. Without any training, pre-training or
fine-tuning, our method achieves results that are competitive with
non-pretrained deep learning methods on six in-distributed datasets. It even
outperforms BERT on all five OOD datasets, including four low-resource
languages. Our method also performs particularly well in few-shot settings
where labeled data are too scarce for DNNs to achieve a satisfying accuracy.",10
1906.02506v2,stat.ML,Practical Deep Learning with Bayesian Principles,"Bayesian methods promise to fix many shortcomings of deep learning, but they
are impractical and rarely match the performance of standard methods, let alone
improve them. In this paper, we demonstrate practical training of deep networks
with natural-gradient variational inference. By applying techniques such as
batch normalisation, data augmentation, and distributed training, we achieve
similar performance in about the same number of epochs as the Adam optimiser,
even on large datasets such as ImageNet. Importantly, the benefits of Bayesian
principles are preserved: predictive probabilities are well-calibrated,
uncertainties on out-of-distribution data are improved, and continual-learning
performance is boosted. This work enables practical deep learning while
preserving benefits of Bayesian principles. A PyTorch implementation is
available as a plug-and-play optimiser.",10
1706.03762v7,cs.CL,Attention Is All You Need,"The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or
convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best
performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention
mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based
solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions
entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be
superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly
less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014
English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results,
including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French
translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art
BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction
of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the
Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to
English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.",10
2307.10169v1,cs.CL,Challenges and Applications of Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) went from non-existent to ubiquitous in the
machine learning discourse within a few years. Due to the fast pace of the
field, it is difficult to identify the remaining challenges and already
fruitful application areas. In this paper, we aim to establish a systematic set
of open problems and application successes so that ML researchers can
comprehend the field's current state more quickly and become productive.",10
2308.01320v1,cs.LG,"DeepSpeed-Chat: Easy, Fast and Affordable RLHF Training of ChatGPT-like Models at All Scales","ChatGPT-like models have revolutionized various applications in artificial
intelligence, from summarization and coding to translation, matching or even
surpassing human performance. However, the current landscape lacks an
accessible, efficient, and cost-effective end-to-end RLHF (Reinforcement
Learning with Human Feedback) training pipeline for these powerful models,
particularly when training at the scale of billions of parameters. This paper
introduces DeepSpeed-Chat, a novel system that democratizes RLHF training,
making it accessible to the AI community. DeepSpeed-Chat offers three key
capabilities: an easy-to-use training and inference experience for ChatGPT-like
models, a DeepSpeed-RLHF pipeline that replicates the training pipeline from
InstructGPT, and a robust DeepSpeed-RLHF system that combines various
optimizations for training and inference in a unified way. The system delivers
unparalleled efficiency and scalability, enabling training of models with
hundreds of billions of parameters in record time and at a fraction of the
cost. With this development, DeepSpeed-Chat paves the way for broader access to
advanced RLHF training, even for data scientists with limited resources,
thereby fostering innovation and further development in the field of AI.",10
2005.14165v4,cs.CL,Language Models are Few-Shot Learners,"Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and
benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on
a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method
still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of
thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language
task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which
current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up
language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes
even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning
approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with
175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model,
and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is
applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot
demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3
achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,
question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require
on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a
novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time,
we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles,
as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to
training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples
of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from
articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding
and of GPT-3 in general.",10
2106.09685v2,cs.CL,LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models,"An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale
pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or
domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all
model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example --
deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B
parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or
LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank
decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly
reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to
GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable
parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA
performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa,
DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher
training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We
also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model
adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package
that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our
implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at
https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.",10
2307.06324v4,math.OC,Provably Faster Gradient Descent via Long Steps,"This work establishes provably faster convergence rates for gradient descent
in smooth convex optimization via a computer-assisted analysis technique. Our
theory allows nonconstant stepsize policies with frequent long steps
potentially violating descent by analyzing the overall effect of many
iterations at once rather than the typical one-iteration inductions used in
most first-order method analyses. We show that long steps, which may increase
the objective value in the short term, lead to provably faster convergence in
the long term. A conjecture towards proving a faster $O(1/T\log T)$ rate for
gradient descent is also motivated along with simple numerical validation.",10
2308.00675v1,cs.CL,Tool Documentation Enables Zero-Shot Tool-Usage with Large Language Models,"Today, large language models (LLMs) are taught to use new tools by providing
a few demonstrations of the tool's usage. Unfortunately, demonstrations are
hard to acquire, and can result in undesirable biased usage if the wrong
demonstration is chosen. Even in the rare scenario that demonstrations are
readily available, there is no principled selection protocol to determine how
many and which ones to provide. As tasks grow more complex, the selection
search grows combinatorially and invariably becomes intractable. Our work
provides an alternative to demonstrations: tool documentation. We advocate the
use of tool documentation, descriptions for the individual tool usage, over
demonstrations. We substantiate our claim through three main empirical findings
on 6 tasks across both vision and language modalities. First, on existing
benchmarks, zero-shot prompts with only tool documentation are sufficient for
eliciting proper tool usage, achieving performance on par with few-shot
prompts. Second, on a newly collected realistic tool-use dataset with hundreds
of available tool APIs, we show that tool documentation is significantly more
valuable than demonstrations, with zero-shot documentation significantly
outperforming few-shot without documentation. Third, we highlight the benefits
of tool documentations by tackling image generation and video tracking using
just-released unseen state-of-the-art models as tools. Finally, we highlight
the possibility of using tool documentation to automatically enable new
applications: by using nothing more than the documentation of GroundingDino,
Stable Diffusion, XMem, and SAM, LLMs can re-invent the functionalities of the
just-released Grounded-SAM and Track Anything models.",10
2308.12950v2,cs.CL,Code Llama: Open Foundation Models for Code,"We release Code Llama, a family of large language models for code based on
Llama 2 providing state-of-the-art performance among open models, infilling
capabilities, support for large input contexts, and zero-shot instruction
following ability for programming tasks. We provide multiple flavors to cover a
wide range of applications: foundation models (Code Llama), Python
specializations (Code Llama - Python), and instruction-following models (Code
Llama - Instruct) with 7B, 13B and 34B parameters each. All models are trained
on sequences of 16k tokens and show improvements on inputs with up to 100k
tokens. 7B and 13B Code Llama and Code Llama - Instruct variants support
infilling based on surrounding content. Code Llama reaches state-of-the-art
performance among open models on several code benchmarks, with scores of up to
53% and 55% on HumanEval and MBPP, respectively. Notably, Code Llama - Python
7B outperforms Llama 2 70B on HumanEval and MBPP, and all our models outperform
every other publicly available model on MultiPL-E. We release Code Llama under
a permissive license that allows for both research and commercial use.",10
2305.14965v1,cs.CL,"Tricking LLMs into Disobedience: Understanding, Analyzing, and Preventing Jailbreaks","Recent explorations with commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
that non-expert users can jailbreak LLMs by simply manipulating the prompts;
resulting in degenerate output behavior, privacy and security breaches,
offensive outputs, and violations of content regulator policies. Limited formal
studies have been carried out to formalize and analyze these attacks and their
mitigations. We bridge this gap by proposing a formalism and a taxonomy of
known (and possible) jailbreaks. We perform a survey of existing jailbreak
methods and their effectiveness on open-source and commercial LLMs (such as GPT
3.5, OPT, BLOOM, and FLAN-T5-xxl). We further propose a limited set of prompt
guards and discuss their effectiveness against known attack types.",10
2301.02737v2,cs.SI,Understanding the (In)Effectiveness of Content Moderation: A Case Study of Facebook in the Context of the U.S. Capitol Riot,"Social media networks commonly employ content moderation as a tool to limit
the spread of harmful content. However, the efficacy of this strategy in
limiting the delivery of harmful content to users is not well understood. In
this paper, we create a framework to quantify the efficacy of content
moderation and use our metrics to analyze content removal on Facebook within
the U.S. news ecosystem. In a data set of over 2M posts with 1.6B user
engagements collected from 2,551 U.S. news sources before and during the
Capitol Riot on January 6, 2021, we identify 10,811 removed posts. We find that
the active engagement life cycle of Facebook posts is very short, with 90% of
all engagement occurring within the first 30 hours after posting. Thus, even
relatively quick intervention allowed significant accrual of engagement before
removal, and prevented only 21% of the predicted engagement potential during a
baseline period before the U.S. Capitol attack. Nearly a week after the attack,
Facebook began removing older content, but these removals occurred so late in
these posts' engagement life cycles that they disrupted less than 1% of
predicted future engagement, highlighting the limited impact of this
intervention. Content moderation likely has limits in its ability to prevent
engagement, especially in a crisis, and we recommend that other approaches such
as slowing down the rate of content diffusion be investigated.",8
2003.01207v1,cs.AI,BARD: A structured technique for group elicitation of Bayesian networks to support analytic reasoning,"In many complex, real-world situations, problem solving and decision making
require effective reasoning about causation and uncertainty. However, human
reasoning in these cases is prone to confusion and error. Bayesian networks
(BNs) are an artificial intelligence technology that models uncertain
situations, supporting probabilistic and causal reasoning and decision making.
However, to date, BN methodologies and software require significant upfront
training, do not provide much guidance on the model building process, and do
not support collaboratively building BNs. BARD (Bayesian ARgumentation via
Delphi) is both a methodology and an expert system that utilises (1) BNs as the
underlying structured representations for better argument analysis, (2) a
multi-user web-based software platform and Delphi-style social processes to
assist with collaboration, and (3) short, high-quality e-courses on demand, a
highly structured process to guide BN construction, and a variety of helpful
tools to assist in building and reasoning with BNs, including an automated
explanation tool to assist effective report writing. The result is an
end-to-end online platform, with associated online training, for groups without
prior BN expertise to understand and analyse a problem, build a model of its
underlying probabilistic causal structure, validate and reason with the causal
model, and use it to produce a written analytic report. Initial experimental
results demonstrate that BARD aids in problem solving, reasoning and
collaboration.",10
2204.02311v5,cs.CL,PaLM: Scaling Language Modeling with Pathways,"Large language models have been shown to achieve remarkable performance
across a variety of natural language tasks using few-shot learning, which
drastically reduces the number of task-specific training examples needed to
adapt the model to a particular application. To further our understanding of
the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter,
densely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language
Model PaLM. We trained PaLM on 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways, a new ML
system which enables highly efficient training across multiple TPU Pods. We
demonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art
few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation
benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, PaLM 540B achieves breakthrough
performance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of
multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the
recently released BIG-bench benchmark. A significant number of BIG-bench tasks
showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance
steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. PaLM also has strong
capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we
demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a
comprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training
data memorization with respect to model scale. Finally, we discuss the ethical
considerations related to large language models and discuss potential
mitigation strategies.",10
2307.12008v1,cond-mat.supr-con,The First Room-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Superconductor,"For the first time in the world, we succeeded in synthesizing the
room-temperature superconductor ($T_c \ge 400$ K, 127$^\circ$C) working at
ambient pressure with a modified lead-apatite (LK-99) structure. The
superconductivity of LK-99 is proved with the Critical temperature ($T_c$),
Zero-resistivity, Critical current ($I_c$), Critical magnetic field ($H_c$),
and the Meissner effect. The superconductivity of LK-99 originates from minute
structural distortion by a slight volume shrinkage (0.48 %), not by external
factors such as temperature and pressure. The shrinkage is caused by Cu$^{2+}$
substitution of Pb$^{2+}$(2) ions in the insulating network of Pb(2)-phosphate
and it generates the stress. It concurrently transfers to Pb(1) of the
cylindrical column resulting in distortion of the cylindrical column interface,
which creates superconducting quantum wells (SQWs) in the interface. The heat
capacity results indicated that the new model is suitable for explaining the
superconductivity of LK-99. The unique structure of LK-99 that allows the
minute distorted structure to be maintained in the interfaces is the most
important factor that LK-99 maintains and exhibits superconductivity at room
temperatures and ambient pressure.",10
2308.15122v1,cs.CL,SpikeBERT: A Language Spikformer Trained with Two-Stage Knowledge Distillation from BERT,"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising avenue to implement deep
neural networks in a more energy-efficient way. However, the network
architectures of existing SNNs for language tasks are too simplistic, and deep
architectures have not been fully explored, resulting in a significant
performance gap compared to mainstream transformer-based networks such as BERT.
To this end, we improve a recently-proposed spiking transformer (i.e.,
Spikformer) to make it possible to process language tasks and propose a
two-stage knowledge distillation method for training it, which combines
pre-training by distilling knowledge from BERT with a large collection of
unlabelled texts and fine-tuning with task-specific instances via knowledge
distillation again from the BERT fine-tuned on the same training examples.
Through extensive experimentation, we show that the models trained with our
method, named SpikeBERT, outperform state-of-the-art SNNs and even achieve
comparable results to BERTs on text classification tasks for both English and
Chinese with much less energy consumption.",6
2308.12939v1,cs.LG,Learning Only On Boundaries: a Physics-Informed Neural operator for Solving Parametric Partial Differential Equations in Complex Geometries,"Recently deep learning surrogates and neural operators have shown promise in
solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, they often require a
large amount of training data and are limited to bounded domains. In this work,
we present a novel physics-informed neural operator method to solve
parametrized boundary value problems without labeled data. By reformulating the
PDEs into boundary integral equations (BIEs), we can train the operator network
solely on the boundary of the domain. This approach reduces the number of
required sample points from $O(N^d)$ to $O(N^{d-1})$, where $d$ is the domain's
dimension, leading to a significant acceleration of the training process.
Additionally, our method can handle unbounded problems, which are unattainable
for existing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators. Our
numerical experiments show the effectiveness of parametrized complex geometries
and unbounded problems.",1

requiring significant time and resources. This paper presents a novel approach
to NN training using Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC), a paradigm that
leverages the principles of adiabatic evolution to solve optimisation problems.
We propose a universal AQC method that can be implemented on gate quantum
computers, allowing for a broad range of Hamiltonians and thus enabling the
training of expressive neural networks. We apply this approach to various
neural networks with continuous, discrete, and binary weights. Our results
indicate that AQC can very efficiently find the global minimum of the loss

(Gl-QFOM) and global quaternion generalized minimum residual (Gl-QGMRES)
methods, which are built upon global orthogonal and oblique projections onto a
quaternion matrix Krylov subspace, for solving quaternion linear systems with
multiple right-hand sides. We first develop the global quaternion Arnoldi
procedure to preserve the quaternion Hessenberg form during the iterations. We
then establish the convergence analysis of the proposed methods, and show how
to apply them to solve the Sylvester quaternion matrix equation. Numerical
examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods compared

expensive to create, and require a great deal of labeled data for specialized
corpora. In this paper, we explore a low resource alternative which is a
bag-of-embedding model for document retrieval and find that it is competitive
with large transformer models fine tuned on information retrieval tasks. Our
results show that a simple combination of TF-IDF, a traditional keyword
matching method, with a shallow embedding model provides a low cost path to
compete well with the performance of complex neural ranking models on 3
datasets. Furthermore, adding TF-IDF measures improves the performance of
large-scale fine tuned models on these tasks.",4

involves the identification of previously unseen intents in user-generated
text. Despite the progress made in this field, challenges persist in handling
new combinations of language components, which is essential for compositional
generalization. In this paper, we present a case study exploring the use of
ChatGPT as a data augmentation technique to enhance compositional
generalization in open intent detection tasks. We begin by discussing the
limitations of existing benchmarks in evaluating this problem, highlighting the
need for constructing datasets for addressing compositional generalization in
open intent detection tasks. By incorporating synthetic data generated by
ChatGPT into the training process, we demonstrate that our approach can
effectively improve model performance. Rigorous evaluation of multiple
benchmarks reveals that our method outperforms existing techniques and
significantly enhances open intent detection capabilities. Our findings
underscore the potential of large language models like ChatGPT for data
augmentation in natural language understanding tasks.",6

utilizing Large Language Models (LLM) for knowledge graph completion. We
consider triples in knowledge graphs as text sequences and introduce an
innovative framework called Knowledge Graph LLM (KG-LLM) to model these
triples. Our technique employs entity and relation descriptions of a triple as
prompts and utilizes the response for predictions. Experiments on various
benchmark knowledge graphs demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art
performance in tasks such as triple classification and relation prediction. We
also find that fine-tuning relatively smaller models (e.g., LLaMA-7B,

affecting the cross-lingual abilities of LLMs. In this paper, we propose to
empower Instructiontuned LLMs (It-LLMs) in languages other than English by
building semantic alignment between them. Hence, we propose CrossAlpaca, an
It-LLM with cross-lingual instruction-following and Translation-following
demonstrations to improve semantic alignment between languages. We validate our
approach on the multilingual Question Answering (QA) benchmarks XQUAD and MLQA
and adapted versions of MMLU and BBH. Our models, tested over six different

outlines a style augmentation algorithm using stochastic-based sampling with
noise addition to improving randomization on a general linear transformation
for style transfer. With our augmentation strategy, all models not only present
incredible robustness against image stylizing but also outperform all previous
methods and surpass the state-of-the-art performance for the STL-10 dataset. In

GPT-3-based models for medical question-answering (MedQA). We perform several
evaluations contextualized in terms of standard medical principles. We provide

computing while yielding quick and accurate results. Additionally, we fine-tune
other pre-trained, masked language models with SetFit, a recent contrastive
learning technique, to achieve state-of-the-art results both in full-data and
few-shot settings. Our findings show that querying GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can
outperform fine-tuned, non-generative models even with fewer examples. However,
subscription fees associated with these solutions may be considered costly for
small organizations. Lastly, we find that generative models perform better on
the given task when shown representative samples selected by a human expert

2308.13782v1,cs.CL,Planning with Logical Graph-based Language Model for Instruction Generation,"Despite the superior performance of large language models to generate natural
language texts, it is hard to generate texts with correct logic according to a
given task, due to the difficulties for neural models to capture implied rules
from free-form texts. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based language
model, Logical-GLM, to infuse logic into language models for more valid text
generation and interpretability. Specifically, we first capture information
from natural language instructions and construct logical bayes graphs that
generally describe domains. Next, we generate logical skeletons to guide
language model training, infusing domain knowledge into language models.
Finally, we alternately optimize the searching policy of graphs and language
models until convergence. The experimental results show that Logical-GLM is
both effective and efficient compared with traditional language models, despite
using smaller-scale training data and fewer parameters. Our approach can
generate instructional texts with more correct logic owing to the internalized
domain knowledge. Moreover, the usage of logical graphs reflects the inner
mechanism of the language models, which improves the interpretability of
black-box models.",4
2308.15126v1,cs.LG,Evaluation and Analysis of Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models,"Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
success. However, LVLMs are still plagued by the hallucination problem, which
limits the practicality in many scenarios. Hallucination refers to the
information of LVLMs' responses that does not exist in the visual input, which
poses potential risks of substantial consequences. There has been limited work
studying hallucination evaluation in LVLMs. In this paper, we propose
Hallucination Evaluation based on Large Language Models (HaELM), an LLM-based
hallucination evaluation framework. HaELM achieves an approximate 95%
performance comparable to ChatGPT and has additional advantages including low
cost, reproducibility, privacy preservation and local deployment. Leveraging

by leveraging the correlation between multiple input features. However, deep
learning-based recommendation models often face challenges due to evolving user
behaviour and item features, leading to covariate shifts. Effective
cross-feature learning is crucial to handle data distribution drift and
adapting to changing user behaviour. Traditional feature interaction techniques
have limitations in achieving optimal performance in this context.
  This work introduces Ad-Rec, an advanced network that leverages feature
interaction techniques to address covariate shifts. This helps eliminate
irrelevant interactions in recommendation tasks. Ad-Rec leverages masked
transformers to enable the learning of higher-order cross-features while
mitigating the impact of data distribution drift. Our approach improves model
quality, accelerates convergence, and reduces training time, as measured by the
Area Under Curve (AUC) metric. We demonstrate the scalability of Ad-Rec and its
ability to achieve superior model quality through comprehensive ablation
studies.",6

requirement increases linearly, while the computational complexity grows
quadratically with the number of time steps. This presents a significant
challenge for numerical simulations, and to the best of our knowledge, it
remains an unresolved issue. In this paper, we present a memory-free algorithm,
based on the incremental SVD technique, that exhibits only linear growth in
computational complexity as the number of time steps increases. We prove that
the error between the solutions generated by the conventional algorithm and our
innovative approach lies within the scope of machine error. Numerical

In this work, we propose the imBalance-Aware Room Layout Estimation (iBARLE)

complex layouts. All modules are jointly trained and help each other to achieve

bridge the gap between texts and structured KBs, we propose a Structured
Knowledge-aware Pre-training method (SKP). In the pre-training stage, we
introduce two novel structured knowledge-aware tasks, guiding the model to
effectively learn the implicit relationship and better representations of
complex subgraphs. In downstream KBQA task, we further design an efficient
linearization strategy and an interval attention mechanism, which assist the

In this paper, we propose the use of a taxonomic loss function that exploits
morphological information to make morphological glossing more performant when
data is scarce. We find that while the use of this loss function does not
outperform a standard loss function with regards to single-label prediction
accuracy, it produces better predictions when considering the top-n predicted

pose particular challenges for Transformer-based systems, as literal
translations often miss the intended meaning. Traditional methods, which
replace idioms using existing knowledge bases (KBs), often lack scale and
context awareness. Addressing these challenges, our approach prioritizes
context awareness and scalability, allowing for offline storage of idioms in a
manageable KB size. This ensures efficient serving with smaller models and
provides a more comprehensive understanding of idiomatic expressions. We
introduce a multilingual idiom KB (IdiomKB) developed using large LMs to
address this. This KB facilitates better translation by smaller models, such as
BLOOMZ (7.1B), Alpaca (7B), and InstructGPT (6.7B), by retrieving idioms'

2308.14893v1,cs.CV,When hard negative sampling meets supervised contrastive learning,"State-of-the-art image models predominantly follow a two-stage strategy:
pre-training on large datasets and fine-tuning with cross-entropy loss. Many
studies have shown that using cross-entropy can result in sub-optimal
generalisation and stability. While the supervised contrastive loss addresses
some limitations of cross-entropy loss by focusing on intra-class similarities
and inter-class differences, it neglects the importance of hard negative
mining. We propose that models will benefit from performance improvement by
weighting negative samples based on their dissimilarity to positive
counterparts. In this paper, we introduce a new supervised contrastive learning
objective, SCHaNe, which incorporates hard negative sampling during the
fine-tuning phase. Without requiring specialized architectures, additional
data, or extra computational resources, experimental results indicate that
SCHaNe outperforms the strong baseline BEiT-3 in Top-1 accuracy across various
benchmarks, with significant gains of up to $3.32\%$ in few-shot learning
settings and $3.41\%$ in full dataset fine-tuning. Importantly, our proposed
objective sets a new state-of-the-art for base models on ImageNet-1k, achieving
an 86.14\% accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed objective

$A$ and $B$ are normal and have well-separated spectra. In this paper, we relax
this normality condition, using the idea of operator dilations. The basic
problem then becomes the lifting of Sylvester equations, which is reminiscent
of the classical commutant lifting theorem and its variations. Our approach

corresponding Hamiltonian system. We make it conformal by introducing a
dissipation term: the result is the continuous model of our scheme. We solve it
via splitting methods (Lie-Trotter and leapfrog): we combine the RATTLE scheme,
approximating the conserved flow, with the exact dissipated flow. The result is
a conformal symplectic method for constant stepsizes. We also propose an

be correlated with the generalization ability of a model when measured at its
hidden representations (hidden margins), no such link between large margins and

model, we show how each functional group affects the overall solubility.
Ultimately, knowing how chemical structure influences chemical properties is
crucial when designing new drugs. Future work should aim to combine the high

2308.15299v1,cs.CL,TaskLAMA: Probing the Complex Task Understanding of Language Models,"Structured Complex Task Decomposition (SCTD) is the problem of breaking down
a complex real-world task (such as planning a wedding) into a directed acyclic
graph over individual steps that contribute to achieving the task, with edges
specifying temporal dependencies between them. SCTD is an important component
of assistive planning tools, and a challenge for commonsense reasoning systems.
We probe how accurately SCTD can be done with the knowledge extracted from
Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce a high-quality human-annotated
dataset for this problem and novel metrics to fairly assess performance of LLMs
against several baselines. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are able to
decompose complex tasks into individual steps effectively, with a relative
improvement of 15% to 280% over the best baseline. We also propose a number of
approaches to further improve their performance, with a relative improvement of
7% to 37% over the base model. However, we find that LLMs still struggle to
predict pairwise temporal dependencies, which reveals a gap in their
understanding of complex tasks.",7

electron energy loss spectra (EELS) that is linear in the fitting parameters.
The model outperforms a power-law both on experimental and simulated
backgrounds, especially for wide energy ranges, and thus improves elemental
quantification results. Owing to the model's linearity, the constraints can be
imposed through fitting by quadratic programming. This has important advantages
over conventional nonlinear power-law fitting such as high speed, not requiring
initial parameters, and a guaranteed unique solution. As such, the need for
user input is significantly reduced, which is essential for unsupervised
treatment of large data sets. This is demonstrated on a demanding spectrum

address the potential inaccuracies or illogical actions arising from LLM, a
combination of teleoperation and Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) is employed
for action correction. This integration aims to improve the practicality and

leaving the interpretation of the data distribution ambiguous. We propose
""Maturity-Aware Distribution Breakdown-based Active Learning'' (MADBAL), an AL
method that benefits from a hierarchical approach to define a multiview data
distribution, which takes into account the different ""sample"" definitions
jointly, hence able to select the most impactful segmentation pixels with
comprehensive understanding. MADBAL also features a novel uncertainty
formulation, where AL supporting modules are included to sense the features'
maturity whose weighted influence continuously contributes to the uncertainty
detection. In this way, MADBAL makes significant performance leaps even in the
early AL stage, hence reducing the training burden significantly. It
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC datasets as
verified in our extensive experiments.",5

has shown promising results for several classes of initial and boundary-value
problems. However, their ability to surpass, particularly in terms of accuracy,
classical discretization methods such as the finite element methods, remains a
significant challenge. Deep learning methods usually struggle to reliably
decrease the error in their approximate solution. A new methodology to better
control the error for deep learning methods is presented here. The main idea
consists in computing an initial approximation to the problem using a simple
neural network and in estimating, in an iterative manner, a correction by
solving the problem for the residual error with a new network of increasing
complexity. This sequential reduction of the residual of the partial
differential equation allows one to decrease the solution error, which, in some
cases, can be reduced to machine precision. The underlying explanation is that
the method is able to capture at each level smaller scales of the solution
using a new network. Numerical examples in 1D and 2D are presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This approach applies
not only to physics informed neural networks but to other neural network
solvers based on weak or strong formulations of the residual.",8

the BSDE and approximates its solution and gradient using deep neural networks
and automatic differentiation at each time step. The approximations are
obtained by sequential minimisation of local quadratic loss functions at each
time step through stochastic gradient descent. We provide an analysis of
approximation error in the case of a network architecture with weight

performance, estimate uncertainty, and improve robustness in deep supervised
learning. However, deep ensembles often come with high computational costs and
memory demands. In addition, the efficiency of a deep ensemble is related to
diversity among the ensemble members which is challenging for large,
over-parameterized deep neural networks. Moreover, ensemble learning has not
yet seen such widespread adoption, and it remains a challenging endeavor for
self-supervised or unsupervised representation learning. Motivated by these
challenges, we present a novel self-supervised training regime that leverages
an ensemble of independent sub-networks, complemented by a new loss function
designed to encourage diversity. Our method efficiently builds a sub-model
ensemble with high diversity, leading to well-calibrated estimates of model
uncertainty, all achieved with minimal computational overhead compared to
traditional deep self-supervised ensembles. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our approach, we conducted extensive experiments across various tasks,
including in-distribution generalization, out-of-distribution detection,

of designing effective, efficient and economic LLM-based Text-to-SQL solutions.
To address this challenge, in this paper, we first conduct a systematical and
extensive comparison over existing prompt engineering methods, including
question representation, example selection and example organization, and with
these experimental results, we elaborates their pros and cons. Based on these
findings, we propose a new integrated solution, named DAIL-SQL, which refreshes
the Spider leaderboard with 86.6% execution accuracy and sets a new bar.
Towards an efficient and economic LLM-based Text-to-SQL solution, we emphasize
the token efficiency in prompt engineering and compare the prior studies under

over-smoothed speech. In this paper, we propose a novel lip-to-speech system
that significantly improves the generation quality by alleviating the
one-to-many mapping problem from multiple perspectives. Specifically, we
incorporate (1) self-supervised speech representations to disambiguate
homophenes, and (2) acoustic variance information to model diverse speech
styles. Additionally, to better solve the aforementioned problem, we employ a
flow based post-net which captures and refines the details of the generated
speech. We perform extensive experiments and demonstrate that our method
achieves the generation quality close to that of real human utterance,

machine learning that enables an accurate forecasting of time series data
generated by dynamical systems. We demonstrate that NG-RC can accurately
predict full many-body quantum dynamics, instead of merely concentrating on the
dynamics of observables, which is the conventional application of reservoir
computing. In addition, we apply a technique which we refer to as skipping
ahead to predict far future states accurately without the need to extract
information about the intermediate states. However, adopting a classical NG-RC
for many-body quantum dynamics prediction is computationally prohibitive due to
the large Hilbert space of sample input data. In this work, we propose an

memory using large language models (LLMs) to enhance long-term memory ability.
Specifically, our method first stimulates LLMs to memorize small dialogue
contexts and then recursively produce new memory using previous memory and
following contexts. Finally, the LLM can easily generate a highly consistent
response with the help of the latest memory. We evaluate our method using
ChatGPT and text-davinci-003, and the experiments on the widely-used public

of the discrete-in-time dynamical system associated to the discretization. We
prove that, as the time step tends to 0, this attractor converges for the
symmmetric Hausdorff distance to an exponential attractor of the
continuous-in-time dynamical system associated with the PDE. We also prove that
the fractal dimension of the exponential attractor (and consequently, of the

creating paragraph-level data for training and meta-evaluating metrics from
existing sentence-level data. Then, we use these new datasets to benchmark
existing sentence-level metrics as well as train learned metrics at the
paragraph level. Interestingly, our experimental results demonstrate that using
sentence-level metrics to score entire paragraphs is equally as effective as
using a metric designed to work at the paragraph level. We speculate this

brain age, which is an important brain health biomarker, from magnetic
resonance (MR) images. However, most of these models only provide a global age
prediction, and rely on techniques, such as saliency maps to interpret their
results. These saliency maps highlight regions in the input image that were
significant for the model's predictions, but they are hard to be interpreted,
and saliency map values are not directly comparable across different samples.
In this work, we reframe the age prediction problem from MR images to an
image-to-image regression problem where we estimate the brain age for each
brain voxel in MR images. We compare voxel-wise age prediction models against
global age prediction models and their corresponding saliency maps. The results
indicate that voxel-wise age prediction models are more interpretable, since
they provide spatial information about the brain aging process, and they
benefit from being quantitative.",2

consistency regularization? In this paper, we conduct empirical studies on
intra-modal and cross-modal consistency and propose two training strategies,
SimRegCR and SimZeroCR, for E2E ST in regular and zero-shot scenarios.
Experiments on the MuST-C benchmark show that our approaches achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in most translation directions. The
analyses prove that regularization brought by the intra-modal consistency,
instead of modality gap, is crucial for the regular E2E ST, and the cross-modal
consistency could close the modality gap and boost the zero-shot E2E ST
performance.",5

wide range of natural images. However, recent studies have indicated that SAM
exhibits subpar performance on 3D medical image segmentation tasks. In addition
to the domain gaps between natural and medical images, disparities in the
spatial arrangement between 2D and 3D images, the substantial computational
burden imposed by powerful GPU servers, and the time-consuming manual prompt
generation impede the extension of SAM to a broader spectrum of medical image
segmentation applications. To address these challenges, in this work, we
introduce a novel method, AutoSAM Adapter, designed specifically for 3D
multi-organ CT-based segmentation. We employ parameter-efficient adaptation
techniques in developing an automatic prompt learning paradigm to facilitate
the transformation of the SAM model's capabilities to 3D medical image
segmentation, eliminating the need for manually generated prompts. Furthermore,
we effectively transfer the acquired knowledge of the AutoSAM Adapter to other
lightweight models specifically tailored for 3D medical image analysis,
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on medical image segmentation

spatial and intra-cyclic dependence from the inter-cyclic variation. In
contrast with the standard incremental approach, which solves the (non-linear

the proposed PGD approach allows the mechanical balance equations to be solved
exclusively for the small-time intra-cyclic response, while the large-time
inter-cyclic response is described by simple scalar algebraic equations.
Numerical simulations exhibiting complex cyclic responses, including a 2D

LLM-Based Offloading (LAMBO) framework for mobile edge computing (MEC), which
comprises four components: (i) Input embedding (IE), which is used to represent
the information of the offloading system with constraints and prompts through
learnable vectors with high quality; (ii) Asymmetric encoderdecoder (AED)
model, which is a decision-making module with a deep encoder and a shallow

2308.15457v1,cs.LG,From SMOTE to Mixup for Deep Imbalanced Classification,"Given imbalanced data, it is hard to train a good classifier using deep
learning because of the poor generalization of minority classes. Traditionally,
the well-known synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) for data
augmentation, a data mining approach for imbalanced learning, has been used to
improve this generalization. However, it is unclear whether SMOTE also benefits
deep learning. In this work, we study why the original SMOTE is insufficient
for deep learning, and enhance SMOTE using soft labels. Connecting the
resulting soft SMOTE with Mixup, a modern data augmentation technique, leads to
a unified framework that puts traditional and modern data augmentation
techniques under the same umbrella. A careful study within this framework shows
that Mixup improves generalization by implicitly achieving uneven margins
between majority and minority classes. We then propose a novel margin-aware
Mixup technique that more explicitly achieves uneven margins. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed technique yields
state-of-the-art performance on deep imbalanced classification while achieving
superior performance on extremely imbalanced data. The code is open-sourced in

structure of the optimality system, three variants can be found for the
Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Dirichlet algorithms. We analyze their
convergence behavior and determine the optimal relaxation parameter for each

Considering that collecting cross-language parallel data, especially for
low-resource languages, is expensive and time-consuming, how designing an
effective cross-language model that does not rely on any parallel data is a
significant problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method named ZC3 for
Zero-shot Cross-language Code Clone detection. ZC3 designs the contrastive

cycle consistency learning to further constrain the model to generate
representations that are aligned among different languages meanwhile are
diacritical for different types of clones. To evaluate our approach, we conduct
extensive experiments on four representative cross-language clone detection

performance in traffic forecasting. However, they often struggle to forecast
congestion accurately due to the limitations of traditional loss functions.
While accurate forecasting of regular traffic conditions is crucial, a reliable
AI system must also accurately forecast congestion scenarios to maintain safe
and efficient transportation. In this paper, we explore various loss functions
inspired by heavy tail analysis and imbalanced classification problems to
address this issue. We evaluate the efficacy of these loss functions in
forecasting traffic speed, with an emphasis on congestion scenarios. Through
extensive experiments on real-world traffic datasets, we discovered that when
optimizing for Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the MAE-Focal Loss function stands
out as the most effective. When optimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE), Gumbel
Loss proves to be the superior choice. These choices effectively forecast
traffic congestion events without compromising the accuracy of regular traffic
speed forecasts. This research enhances deep learning models' capabilities in
forecasting sudden speed changes due to congestion and underscores the need for
more research in this direction. By elevating the accuracy of congestion
forecasting, we advocate for AI systems that are reliable, secure, and

Adversarial training and adversarial purification are among the most widely

this study, we theoretically analyze the logit difference around successful
adversarial attacks from a theoretical point of view and propose a new
principle, namely Adversarial Logit Update (ALU), to infer adversarial sample's
labels. Based on ALU, we introduce a new classification paradigm that utilizes
pre- and post-purification logit differences for model's adversarial robustness
boost. Without requiring adversarial or additional data for model training, our
clean data synthesis model can be easily applied to various pre-trained models
for both adversarial sample detection and ALU-based data classification.
Extensive experiments on both CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and tiny-ImageNet datasets

many recommender systems incapable of providing hitherto unseen users with

long-tailed, wherein the majority classes have the most of the samples that
dominate the model training. In such setting, the naive model tends to have
poor performance on the minority classes. Previously, a variety of loss
modifications have been proposed to address the long-tailed leaning problem,
while these methods either treat the samples in the same class
indiscriminatingly or lack a theoretical guarantee. In this paper, we propose
two novel approaches based on CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) to improve the
performance of long-tailed learning with a solid theoretical ground.
Specifically, we firstly introduce a Label-Aware Bounded CVaR (LAB-CVaR) loss
to overcome the pessimistic result of the original CVaR, and further design the
optimal weight bounds for LAB-CVaR theoretically. Based on LAB-CVaR, we

scarcity and costliness of real-world datasets necessitate efficient learning
approaches. In this letter, we exploit Euclidean symmetry in planning for 2D
navigation, which originates from Euclidean transformations between reference
frames and enables parameter sharing. To address the challenges of unstructured
environments, we formulate the navigation problem as planning on a geometric
graph and develop an equivariant message passing network to perform value
iteration. Furthermore, to handle multi-camera input, we propose a learnable
equivariant layer to lift features to a desired space. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations across five diverse tasks encompassing structured and unstructured
environments, along with maps of known and unknown, given point goals or
semantic goals. Our experiments confirm the substantial benefits on training
efficiency, stability, and generalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13043v1

augmentation approach for large vocabulary instance segmentation. Our method is
training-free and does not rely on any label supervision. Two key designs
enable us to employ an off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion model as a useful
dataset generator for object instances and mask annotations. First, we divide
an image canvas into several regions and perform a single round of diffusion
process to generate multiple instances simultaneously, conditioning on
different text prompts. Second, we obtain corresponding instance masks by
aggregating cross-attention maps associated with object prompts across layers
and diffusion time steps, followed by simple thresholding and edge-aware
refinement processing. Without bells and whistles, our MosaicFusion can produce
a significant amount of synthetic labeled data for both rare and novel
categories. Experimental results on the challenging LVIS long-tailed and
open-vocabulary benchmarks demonstrate that MosaicFusion can significantly
improve the performance of existing instance segmentation models, especially
for rare and novel categories. Code will be released at

automatic speech recognition (ASR), outperforming recurrent neural
network-based approaches and transformers. Nevertheless, in general, the
performance of these end-to-end models, especially attention-based models, is
particularly degraded in the case of long utterances. To address this
limitation, we propose adding a fully-differentiable memory-augmented neural
network between the encoder and decoder of a conformer. This external memory
can enrich the generalization for longer utterances since it allows the system
to store and retrieve more information recurrently. Notably, we explore the
neural Turing machine (NTM) that results in our proposed Conformer-NTM model
architecture for ASR. Experimental results using Librispeech train-clean-100
and train-960 sets show that the proposed system outperforms the baseline
conformer without memory for long utterances.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13029v1

practices and ensuring crop resilience in varying climates. Integrating weather
data across the growing season, especially for different crop varieties, is
crucial for understanding their adaptability in the face of climate change. In
the MLCAS2021 Crop Yield Prediction Challenge, we utilized a dataset comprising
93,028 training records to forecast yields for 10,337 test records, covering
159 locations across 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces over 13 years
(2003-2015). This dataset included details on 5,838 distinct genotypes and
daily weather data for a 214-day growing season, enabling comprehensive
analysis. As one of the winning teams, we developed two novel convolutional
neural network (CNN) architectures: the CNN-DNN model, combining CNN and
fully-connected networks, and the CNN-LSTM-DNN model, with an added LSTM layer
for weather variables. Leveraging the Generalized Ensemble Method (GEM), we
determined optimal model weights, resulting in superior performance compared to
baseline models. The GEM model achieved lower RMSE (5.55% to 39.88%), reduced
MAE (5.34% to 43.76%), and higher correlation coefficients (1.1% to 10.79%)
when evaluated on test data. We applied the CNN-DNN model to identify
top-performing genotypes for various locations and weather conditions, aiding

their mettle by achieving enhanced predictive performance. In our
investigation, we delve into the efficacy of the relatively recent Gated

metaheuristic algorithms, evaluating their performance by leveraging
established numerical benchmarks such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean
Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Our empirical investigations are conducted
using power load data originating from the Ontario province, Canada. Our

computational cost of DNNs while retaining high accuracy. In particular, N:M
fine-grained structured sparsity, where only N out of consecutive M elements
can be nonzero, has attracted attention due to its hardware-friendly pattern
and capability of achieving a high sparse ratio. However, the potential to
accelerate N:M sparse DNN training has not been fully exploited, and there is a
lack of efficient hardware supporting N:M sparse training. To tackle these
challenges, this paper presents a computation-efficient training scheme for N:M
sparse DNNs using algorithm, architecture, and dataflow co-design. At the
algorithm level, a bidirectional weight pruning method, dubbed BDWP, is
proposed to leverage the N:M sparsity of weights during both forward and
backward passes of DNN training, which can significantly reduce the
computational cost while maintaining model accuracy. At the architecture level,
a sparse accelerator for DNN training, namely SAT, is developed to neatly
support both the regular dense operations and the computation-efficient N:M
sparse operations. At the dataflow level, multiple optimization methods ranging
from interleave mapping, pre-generation of N:M sparse weights, and offline
scheduling, are proposed to boost the computational efficiency of SAT. Finally,
the effectiveness of our training scheme is evaluated on a Xilinx VCU1525 FPGA
card using various DNN models and datasets. Experimental results show the SAT
accelerator with the BDWP sparse training method under 2:8 sparse ratio
achieves an average speedup of 1.75x over that with the dense training,
accompanied by a negligible accuracy loss of 0.56% on average. Furthermore, our

Motivated by the society of minds (Minsky, 1988), we propose ReConcile, a
multi-model multi-agent framework designed as a round table conference among
diverse LLM agents to foster diverse thoughts and discussion for improved
consensus. ReConcile enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs by holding
multiple rounds of discussion, learning to convince other agents to improve
their answers, and employing a confidence-weighted voting mechanism. In each
round, ReConcile initiates discussion between agents via a 'discussion prompt'
that consists of (a) grouped answers and explanations generated by each agent
in the previous round, (b) their uncertainties, and (c) demonstrations of
answer-rectifying human explanations, used for convincing other agents. This
discussion prompt enables each agent to revise their responses in light of
insights from other agents. Once a consensus is reached and the discussion
ends, ReConcile determines the final answer by leveraging the confidence of
each agent in a weighted voting scheme. We implement ReConcile with ChatGPT,
Bard, and Claude2 as the three agents. Our experimental results on various
benchmarks demonstrate that ReConcile significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of the agents (both individually and as a team), surpassing prior
single-agent and multi-agent baselines by 7.7% and also outperforming GPT-4 on
some of these datasets. We also experiment with GPT-4 itself as one of the
agents in ReConcile and demonstrate that its initial performance also improves
by absolute 10.0% through discussion and feedback from other agents. Finally,
we also analyze the accuracy after every round and observe that ReConcile
achieves better and faster consensus between agents, compared to a multi-agent
debate baseline. Our code is available at: https://github.com/dinobby/ReConcile",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13007v1

learning, various domain generalization (DG) techniques have been developed to
enhance the performance of machine learning systems when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Furthermore, in real-world scenarios, data
distributions can gradually change across a sequence of sequential domains.
While current methodologies primarily focus on improving model effectiveness
within these new domains, they often overlook fairness issues throughout the
learning process. In response, we introduce an innovative framework called
Counterfactual Fairness-Aware Domain Generalization with Sequential Autoencoder
(CDSAE). This approach effectively separates environmental information and
sensitive attributes from the embedded representation of classification
features. This concurrent separation not only greatly improves model
generalization across diverse and unfamiliar domains but also effectively
addresses challenges related to unfair classification. Our strategy is rooted
in the principles of causal inference to tackle these dual issues. To examine
the intricate relationship between semantic information, sensitive attributes,
and environmental cues, we systematically categorize exogenous uncertainty
factors into four latent variables: 1) semantic information influenced by
sensitive attributes, 2) semantic information unaffected by sensitive
attributes, 3) environmental cues influenced by sensitive attributes, and 4)
environmental cues unaffected by sensitive attributes. By incorporating
fairness regularization, we exclusively employ semantic information for
classification purposes. Empirical validation on synthetic and real-world
datasets substantiates the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating
improved accuracy levels while ensuring the preservation of fairness in the
evolving landscape of continuous domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13005v1

technique to extract these explanations from a large parallel corpus.
Experiments on English->German language pair show that our method is able to
extract sentence so that more than 10% of the sentences contain explanation,
while only 1.9% of the original sentences contain explanations. In addition,
experiments on English->French and English->Chinese language pairs also show

higher-order interactions. Current SC-based GNNs are burdened by high
complexity and rigidity, and quantifying higher-order interaction strengths
remains challenging. Innovatively, we present a higher-order Flower-Petals (FP)
model, incorporating FP Laplacians into SCs. Further, we introduce a
Higher-order Graph Convolutional Network (HiGCN) grounded in FP Laplacians,
capable of discerning intrinsic features across varying topological scales. By
employing learnable graph filters, a parameter group within each FP Laplacian

quantifiable measure of higher-order interaction strengths. The theoretical
underpinnings of HiGCN's advanced expressiveness are rigorously demonstrated.

investigate the use of (instruction-following) large language models (LLMs) to
assist developers in revising code to resolve code quality issues. We present a
tool, CORE (short for COde REvisions), architected using a pair of LLMs
organized as a duo comprised of a proposer and a ranker. Providers of static
analysis tools recommend ways to mitigate the tool warnings and developers
follow them to revise their code. The \emph{proposer LLM} of CORE takes the
same set of recommendations and applies them to generate candidate code
revisions. The candidates which pass the static quality checks are retained.
However, the LLM may introduce subtle, unintended functionality changes which
may go un-detected by the static analysis. The \emph{ranker LLM} evaluates the
changes made by the proposer using a rubric that closely follows the acceptance
criteria that a developer would enforce. CORE uses the scores assigned by the
ranker LLM to rank the candidate revisions before presenting them to the
developer. CORE could revise 59.2% Python files (across 52 quality checks) so
that they pass scrutiny by both a tool and a human reviewer. The ranker LLM is

While this data model supports advanced reasoning and querying, they remain
difficult to mine due to their size and complexity. Graph mining approaches can
be used to extract patterns from KGs. However this presents two main issues.
First, graph mining approaches tend to extract too many patterns for a human
analyst to interpret (pattern explosion). Second, real-life KGs tend to differ
from the graphs usually treated in graph mining: they are multigraphs, their
vertex degrees tend to follow a power-law, and the way in which they model
knowledge can produce spurious patterns. Recently, a graph mining approach
named GraphMDL+ has been proposed to tackle the problem of pattern explosion,
using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. However, GraphMDL+, like
other graph mining approaches, is not suited for KGs without adaptations. In
this paper we propose KG-MDL, a graph pattern mining approach based on the MDL
principle that, given a KG, generates a human-sized and descriptive set of
graph patterns, and so in a parameter-less and anytime way. We report on
experiments on medium-sized KGs showing that our approach generates sets of
patterns that are both small enough to be interpreted by humans and descriptive
of the KG. We show that the extracted patterns highlight relevant

ProtoEM extracts event relations in a two-step manner, i.e., prototype

represent the prototypes corresponding to these relations. Subsequently, to
capture the interdependence among event relations, it constructs a dependency
graph for the prototypes corresponding to these relations and utilized a Graph
Neural Network (GNN)-based module for modeling. In the second step, it obtains
the representations of new event pairs and calculates their similarity with

line was recently resolved by accounting for the atom's hyperfine structure and
the detailed spectral structure of the incident radiation field. That modeling
relied on the simplifying angle-averaged (AA) approximation for partial
frequency redistribution (PRD) in scattering, which potentially neglects
important angle-frequency couplings. This work aims at evaluating the
suitability of a PRD-AA modeling for the D1 and D2 lines through comparisons
with general angle-dependent (AD) PRD calculations, both in the absence and
presence of magnetic fields. We solved the radiative transfer problem for
polarized radiation in a one-dimensional semi-empirical atmospheric model with
microturbulent and isotropic magnetic fields, accounting for PRD effects,
comparing PRD-AA and PRD-AD modelings. The D1 and D2 lines are modeled
separately as two-level atomic system with hyperfine structure. The numerical
results confirm that a spectrally structured radiation field induces linear
polarization in the D1 line. However, the PRD-AA approximation greatly impacts
the Q/I shape, producing an antisymmetric pattern instead of the more symmetric
PRD-AD one, while presenting a similar sensitivity to magnetic fields between
10 and 200 G. Under the PRD-AA approximation, the Q/I profile of the D2 line
presents an artificial dip in its core, which is not found for the PRD-AD case.

introduces a new type of pixel-based anchor that dynamically moves towards the
targeted lesion for detection. We refer to this new architecture as GravityNet,
and the novel anchors as gravity points since they appear to be ""attracted"" by
the lesions. We conducted experiments on two well-established medical problems
involving small lesions to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach:
microcalcifications detection in digital mammograms and microaneurysms

similarity (STS) tasks, which are crucial components in Large Language Model
(LLM) applications. However, a common challenge existing text embedding models
face is the problem of vanishing gradients, primarily due to their reliance on
the cosine function in the optimization objective, which has saturation zones.
To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel angle-optimized text
embedding model called AnglE. The core idea of AnglE is to introduce angle
optimization in a complex space. This novel approach effectively mitigates the
adverse effects of the saturation zone in the cosine function, which can impede
gradient and hinder optimization processes. To set up a comprehensive STS
evaluation, we experimented on existing short-text STS datasets and a newly
collected long-text STS dataset from GitHub Issues. Furthermore, we examine
domain-specific STS scenarios with limited labeled data and explore how AnglE
works with LLM-annotated data. Extensive experiments were conducted on various
tasks including short-text STS, long-text STS, and domain-specific STS tasks.
The results show that AnglE outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) STS models
that ignore the cosine saturation zone. These findings demonstrate the ability
of AnglE to generate high-quality text embeddings and the usefulness of angle
optimization in STS.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12871v1

frames from a decoded video and then conduct a subsequent process (e.g.,
feature extraction and/or captioning model learning). In this pipeline, manual
frame sampling may ignore key information in videos and thus degrade
performance. Additionally, redundant information in the sampled frames may
result in low efficiency in the inference of video captioning. Addressing this,
we study video captioning from a different perspective in compressed domain,
which brings multi-fold advantages over the existing pipeline: 1) Compared to
raw images from the decoded video, the compressed video, consisting of
I-frames, motion vectors and residuals, is highly distinguishable, which allows
us to leverage the entire video for learning without manual sampling through a
specialized model design; 2) The captioning model is more efficient in
inference as smaller and less redundant information is processed. We propose a
simple yet effective end-to-end transformer in the compressed domain for video
captioning that enables learning from the compressed video for captioning. We
show that even with a simple design, our method can achieve state-of-the-art

applications recently, which aims to recommend the next item based on the
user's historical interactions. However, sequential recommendation often faces
the problem of data sparsity, which widely exists in recommender systems.
Besides, most users only interact with a few items, but existing SRS models
often underperform these users. Such a problem, named the long-tail user
problem, is still to be resolved. Data augmentation is a distinct way to
alleviate these two problems, but they often need fabricated training
strategies or are hindered by poor-quality generated interactions. To address
these problems, we propose a Diffusion Augmentation for Sequential
Recommendation (DiffuASR) for a higher quality generation. The augmented
dataset by DiffuASR can be used to train the sequential recommendation models
directly, free from complex training procedures. To make the best of the
generation ability of the diffusion model, we first propose a diffusion-based
pseudo sequence generation framework to fill the gap between image and sequence
generation. Then, a sequential U-Net is designed to adapt the diffusion noise
prediction model U-Net to the discrete sequence generation task. At last, we
develop two guide strategies to assimilate the preference between generated and
origin sequences. To validate the proposed DiffuASR, we conduct extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets with three sequential recommendation

Circulation Models (GCMs) is to understand the horizontal discretization of the

accuracy and stability of different methods used in, or adequate for,
unstructured ocean models considering shallow water models. Our results show
that the schemes have different accuracy capabilities, with the A- (NICAM) and
B-grid (FeSOM 2.0) schemes providing at least 1st order accuracy in most
operators and time integrated variables, while the two C-grid (ICON and MPAS)
schemes display more difficulty in adequately approximating the horizontal
dynamics. Moreover, the theory of the inertia-gravity wave representation on
regular grids can be extended for our unstructured based schemes, where from
least to most accurate we have: A-, B, and C-grid, respectively. Considering
only C-grid schemes, the MPAS scheme has shown a more accurate representation
of inertia-gravity waves than ICON. In terms of stability, we see that both A-
and C-grid MPAS scheme display the best stability properties, but the A-grid
scheme relies on artificial diffusion, while the C-grid scheme doesn't.
Alongside, the B-grid and C-grid ICON schemes are within the least stable.
Finally, in an effort to understand the effects of potential instabilities in
ICON, we note that the full 3D model without a filtering term does not
destabilize as it is integrated in time. However, spurious oscillations are
responsible for decreasing the kinetic energy of the oceanic currents.
Furthermore, an additional decrease of the currents' turbulent kinetic energy

exacerbated the need for low-cost ML implementation, specifically for
resource-constrained embedded systems. To this end, approximate computing, an
approach that explores the power, performance, area (PPA), and behavioral
accuracy (BEHAV) trade-offs, has emerged as a possible solution for
implementing embedded machine learning. Due to the predominance of MAC
operations in ML, designing platform-specific approximate arithmetic operators
forms one of the major research problems in approximate computing. Recently
there has been a rising usage of AI/ML-based design space exploration
techniques for implementing approximate operators. However, most of these
approaches are limited to using ML-based surrogate functions for predicting the
PPA and BEHAV impact of a set of related design decisions. While this approach
leverages the regression capabilities of ML methods, it does not exploit the
more advanced approaches in ML. To this end, we propose AxOCS, a methodology
for designing approximate arithmetic operators through ML-based supersampling.
Specifically, we present a method to leverage the correlation of PPA and BEHAV
metrics across operators of varying bit-widths for generating larger bit-width
operators. The proposed approach involves traversing the relatively smaller
design space of smaller bit-width operators and employing its associated
Design-PPA-BEHAV relationship to generate initial solutions for

predicting neural responses. To gain insight into this, we use a recent
theoretical framework that relates the generalization error from regression to
the spectral bias of the model activations and the alignment of the neural
responses onto the learnable subspace of the model. We extend this theory to
the case of regression between model activations and neural responses, and
define geometrical properties describing the error embedding geometry. We test
a large number of deep neural networks that predict visual cortical activity

challenges posed by collecting large-scale accurate labels, making noisy labels
a more practical alternative. Motivated by noisy multi-class learning, the
introduction of transition matrices can help model multi-label noise and enable
the development of statistically consistent algorithms for noisy multi-label
learning. However, estimating multi-label noise transition matrices remains a
challenging task, as most existing estimators in noisy multi-class learning
rely on anchor points and accurate fitting of noisy class posteriors, which is
hard to satisfy in noisy multi-label learning. In this paper, we address this
problem by first investigating the identifiability of class-dependent
transition matrices in noisy multi-label learning. Building upon the
identifiability results, we propose a novel estimator that leverages label

two noisy labels to capture noisy label correlations. Subsequently, we employ
sample selection techniques to extract information implying clean label
correlations, which are then used to estimate the occurrence probability of one
noisy label when a certain clean label appears. By exploiting the mismatches in
label correlations implied by these occurrence probabilities, we demonstrate
that the transition matrix becomes identifiable and can be acquired by solving
a bilinear decomposition problem. Theoretically, we establish an estimation
error bound for our multi-label transition matrix estimator and derive a
generalization error bound for our statistically consistent algorithm.

intelligence, posing significant challenges in finding efficient solutions.
Conversely, recent advancements in quantum technologies have shown promising
potential for achieving substantial computational speedup, particularly in
certain problem classes, such as combinatorial optimization. In this study, we
introduce QAL-BP, a novel Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)
formulation designed specifically for bin packing and suitable for quantum
computation. QAL-BP utilizes the augmented Lagrangian method to incorporate the
bin packing constraints into the objective function while also facilitating an
analytical estimation of heuristic, but empirically robust, penalty
multipliers. This approach leads to a more versatile and generalizable model
that eliminates the need for empirically calculating instance-dependent
Lagrangian coefficients, a requirement commonly encountered in alternative QUBO
formulations for similar problems. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed
approach, we conduct experiments on a set of bin-packing instances using a real
Quantum Annealing device. Additionally, we compare the results with those
obtained from two different classical solvers, namely simulated annealing and
Gurobi. The experimental findings not only confirm the correctness of the
proposed formulation but also demonstrate the potential of quantum computation
in effectively solving the bin-packing problem, particularly as more reliable
quantum technology becomes available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12678v1

practical traffic tasks. However, capturing the diversity of trajectories
presents challenges, particularly with traditional machine learning and
recurrent neural networks due to the requirement of large-scale parameters. The
emerging Transformer technology, renowned for its parallel computation
capabilities enabling the utilization of models with hundreds of millions of
parameters, offers a promising solution. In this study, we apply the
Transformer architecture to traffic tasks, aiming to learn the diversity of
trajectories within vehicle populations. We analyze the Transformer's attention
mechanism and its adaptability to the goals of traffic tasks, and subsequently,
design specific pre-training tasks. To achieve this, we create a data structure
tailored to the attention mechanism and introduce a set of noises that
correspond to spatio-temporal demands, which are incorporated into the
structured data during the pre-training process. The designed pre-training
model demonstrates excellent performance in capturing the spatial distribution
of the vehicle population, with no instances of vehicle overlap and an RMSE of
0.6059 when compared to the ground truth values. In the context of time series
prediction, approximately 95% of the predicted trajectories' speeds closely
align with the true speeds, within a deviation of 7.5144m/s. Furthermore, in
the stability test, the model exhibits robustness by continuously predicting a
time series ten times longer than the input sequence, delivering smooth
trajectories and showcasing diverse driving behaviors. The pre-trained model
also provides a good basis for downstream fine-tuning tasks. The number of
parameters of our model is over 50 million.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12677v1

using the convex conjugate of the sparse entropic regularizer. Building upon
this, we derive the sparse memory retrieval dynamics from the sparse energy
function and show its one-step approximation is equivalent to the
sparse-structured attention. Importantly, we provide a sparsity-dependent
memory retrieval error bound which is provably tighter than its dense analog.
The conditions for the benefits of sparsity to arise are therefore identified

algorithms with a performance improvement guarantee is challenging, mainly
attributed to the high coupling between model learning and policy optimization.
Many prior methods that rely on return discrepancy to guide model learning

due to excessive model updates. Other methods use performance difference bound
to explicitly consider model shift. However, these methods rely on a fixed
threshold to constrain model shift, resulting in a heavy dependence on the
threshold and a lack of adaptability during the training process. In this
paper, we theoretically derive an optimization objective that can unify model
shift and model bias and then formulate a fine-tuning process. This process
adaptively adjusts the model updates to get a performance improvement guarantee

object classification, the biomedical image processing society is also
overwhelmed with their applications to various automatic diagnosis cases.
Unfortunately, most of the deep learning-based classification attempts in the
literature solely focus on the aim of extreme accuracy scores, without
considering interpretability, or patient-wise separation of training and test
data. For example, most lung nodule classification papers using deep learning
randomly shuffle data and split it into training, validation, and test sets,
causing certain images from the CT scan of a person to be in the training set,
while other images of the exact same person to be in the validation or testing
image sets. This can result in reporting misleading accuracy rates and the
learning of irrelevant features, ultimately reducing the real-life usability of
these models. When the deep neural networks trained on the traditional, unfair
data shuffling method are challenged with new patient images, it is observed
that the trained models perform poorly. In contrast, deep neural networks
trained with strict patient-level separation maintain their accuracy rates even
when new patient images are tested. Heat-map visualizations of the activations

distributed networks using a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The
network includes wireless channels with direct links between users and RIS
links connecting users to the RIS. To maximize average system throughput, an
optimal channel access strategy is proposed, considering the trade-off between
exploiting spatial diversity gain with RIS assistance and the overhead of
channel probing. The paper proposes an optimal distributed Carrier Sense
Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) strategy with opportunistic
RIS assistance, based on statistics theory of optimal sequential observation
planned decision. Each source-destination pair makes decisions regarding the
use of direct links and/or probing source-RIS-destination links. Channel access
occurs in a distributed manner after successful channel contention. The
optimality of the strategy is rigorously derived using multiple-level pure
thresholds. A distributed algorithm, which achieves significantly lower online

through both formal proofs and empirical results. In this paper, we make a
comprehensive overview of the current state of research in KG completion. In
particular, we focus on two main branches of KG embedding (KGE) design: 1)
distance-based methods and 2) semantic matching-based methods. We discover the
connections between recently proposed models and present an underlying trend

aspect that has been largely overlooked in previous works. Specifically, we
focus on the interactions between the frequency of gendered profession names in

gender bias. We observe that female and non-stereotypical gender inflections of
profession names (e.g., Spanish ""doctora"" for ""female doctor"") tend to be split
into multiple subword tokens. Our results indicate that the imbalance of gender
forms in the model's training corpus is a major factor contributing to gender
bias and has a greater impact than subword splitting. We show that analyzing
subword splits provides good estimates of gender-form imbalance in the training
data and can be used even when the corpus is not publicly available. We also

such learned model to both (1) inform reward shaping during an agent's

computational costs in self-attention layers as that of 2048. In this paper, we
speed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand,
although dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the
model can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The
proposed shift short attention effectively enables context extension, leading
to non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with
vanilla attention. Particularly, it can be implemented with only two lines of
code in training, while being optional in inference. On the other hand, we

geographical locations with diverse conditions and rules of the road, e.g.,
left vs. right-hand traffic. In contrast, existing models for autonomous
driving have been thus far only deployed within restricted operational domains,
i.e., without accounting for varying driving behaviors across locations or
model scalability. In this work, we propose AnyD, a single geographically-aware
conditional imitation learning (CIL) model that can efficiently learn from
heterogeneous and globally distributed data with dynamic environmental,
traffic, and social characteristics. Our key insight is to introduce a
high-capacity geo-location-based channel attention mechanism that effectively
adapts to local nuances while also flexibly modeling similarities among regions
in a data-driven manner. By optimizing a contrastive imitation objective, our
proposed approach can efficiently scale across inherently imbalanced data
distributions and location-dependent events. We demonstrate the benefits of our
AnyD agent across multiple datasets, cities, and scalable deployment paradigms,
i.e., centralized, semi-supervised, and distributed agent training.
Specifically, AnyD outperforms CIL baselines by over 14% in open-loop

language models (LLMs). If a model is trained on a sentence of the form ""A is
B"", it will not automatically generalize to the reverse direction ""B is A"".
This is the Reversal Curse. For instance, if a model is trained on ""Olaf Scholz
was the ninth Chancellor of Germany"", it will not automatically be able to
answer the question, ""Who was the ninth Chancellor of Germany?"". Moreover, the
likelihood of the correct answer (""Olaf Scholz"") will not be higher than for a
random name. Thus, models exhibit a basic failure of logical deduction and do
not generalize a prevalent pattern in their training set (i.e. if ""A is B''
occurs, ""B is A"" is more likely to occur). We provide evidence for the Reversal
Curse by finetuning GPT-3 and Llama-1 on fictitious statements such as ""Uriah
Hawthorne is the composer of 'Abyssal Melodies'"" and showing that they fail to
correctly answer ""Who composed 'Abyssal Melodies?'"". The Reversal Curse is
robust across model sizes and model families and is not alleviated by data
augmentation. We also evaluate ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on questions about
real-world celebrities, such as ""Who is Tom Cruise's mother? [A: Mary Lee
Pfeiffer]"" and the reverse ""Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?"". GPT-4 correctly
answers questions like the former 79% of the time, compared to 33% for the
latter. This shows a failure of logical deduction that we hypothesize is caused

profound understanding of the real-world background, which remains challenging
for detectors based on small language models (SLMs) due to their knowledge and
capability limitations. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMs could
help with fake news detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate the potential of LLMs in fake news detection. First, we conduct an
empirical study and find that a sophisticated LLM such as GPT 3.5 could
generally expose fake news and provide desirable multi-perspective rationales
but still underperforms the basic SLM, fine-tuned BERT. Our subsequent analysis
attributes such a gap to the LLM's inability to select and integrate rationales
properly to conclude. Based on these findings, we propose that current LLMs may
not substitute fine-tuned SLMs in fake news detection but can be a good advisor
for SLMs by providing multi-perspective instructive rationales. To instantiate
this proposal, we design an adaptive rationale guidance network for fake news
detection (ARG), in which SLMs selectively acquire insights on news analysis
from the LLMs' rationales. We further derive a rationale-free version of ARG by
distillation, namely ARG-D, which services cost-sensitive scenarios without
inquiring LLMs. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that ARG and

biometric verification to improve reliablity in the face of spoofing attacks.
Even though the two sub-systems operate in tandem to solve the single task of

suboptimal. We introduce a new metric for the joint evaluation of PAD solutions
operating in situ with biometric verification. In contrast to the tandem
detection cost function proposed recently, the new tandem equal error rate

to a \emph{set} of operating points at which false alarm and miss rates are

development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) that employ a Large Language

common strategy for developing these datasets involves generating synthetic
student-teacher dialogues using advanced GPT-4 models. However, challenges
arise when these dialogues demand complex calculations, common in subjects like
physics. Despite its advanced capabilities, GPT-4's performance falls short in
reliably handling even simple multiplication tasks, marking a significant
limitation in its utility for these subjects. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces an innovative stateful prompt design. Our approach generates a
mock conversation between a student and a tutorbot, both roles simulated by

GPT-tutorbot, which assesses whether its response would necessitate
calculations. If so, it proceeds to script the required code in Python and then
uses the resulting output to construct its response to the student. Our
approach notably enhances the quality of synthetic conversation datasets,

our Higgs model -- a LLaMA finetuned with datasets generated through our novel

content on social media, similar resources in Arabic are still immature. The
main reason that the resources in Arabic are insufficient is that Arabic has
many dialects in addition to the standard version (MSA). Arabs do not use MSA
in their daily communications; rather, they use dialectal versions.
Unfortunately, social users transfer this phenomenon into their use of social
media platforms, which in turn has raised an urgent need for building suitable
AI models for language-dependent applications. Existing machine translation
(MT) systems designed for MSA fail to work well with Arabic dialects. In light
of this, it is necessary to adapt to the informal nature of communication on
social networks by developing MT systems that can effectively handle the
various dialects of Arabic. Unlike for MSA that shows advanced progress in MT
systems, little effort has been exerted to utilize Arabic dialects for MT
systems. While few attempts have been made to build translation datasets for
dialectal Arabic, they are domain dependent and are not OSN cultural-language
friendly. In this work, we attempt to alleviate these limitations by proposing
an online social network-based multidialect Arabic dataset that is crafted by
contextually translating English tweets into four Arabic dialects: Gulf,
Yemeni, Iraqi, and Levantine. To perform the translation, we followed our
proposed guideline framework for content translation, which could be
universally applicable for translation between foreign languages and local
dialects. We validated the authenticity of our proposed dataset by developing
neural MT models for four Arabic dialects. Our results have shown a superior

standard CMAB usually assumes the workers always stay in the system, whereas
the workers may join in or depart from the system over time, such that what we
have learnt for an individual worker cannot be applied after the worker leaves.
To address the above challenging issues, in this paper, we first propose an
off-line Context-Aware CMAB-based Incentive (CACI) mechanism. We innovate in
leveraging the exploration-exploitation trade-off in a elaborately partitioned
context space instead of the individual workers, to effectively incentivize the
massive unknown workers with very limited budget. We also extend the above
basic idea to the on-line setting where unknown workers may join in or depart
from the systems dynamically, and propose an on-line version of the CACI
mechanism. Specifically, by the exploitation-exploration trade-off in the
context space, we learn to estimate the sensing ability of any unknown worker

information. We perform rigorous theoretical analysis to reveal the upper

In this paper, we propose a protocol based on reinforcement learning and
vehicle node clustering, the protocol is called Qucts, solve
vehicle-to-fixed-destination or V2V messaging problems. Improve message
delivery rates with minimal hops and latency, link stability is also taken into
account. The agreement is divided into three levels, first cluster the
vehicles, each cluster head broadcasts its own coordinates and speed, to get
more cluster members. Also when a cluster member receives another cluster head
broadcast message, the cluster head generates a list of surrounding clusters,
find the best cluster to the destination as the next cluster during message
passing. Second, the protocol constructs a Q-value table based on the state
after clustering, used to participate in the selection of messaging clusters.
Finally, we introduce parameters that express the stability of the vehicle
within the cluster, for communication node selection. This protocol hierarchy
makes Qucts an offline and online solution. In order to distinguish unstable
nodes within a cluster, Coding of each road, will have vehicles with planned
routes, For example, car hailing and public bus. Compare the overlap with other
planned paths vehicles in the cluster, low overlap is labeled as unstable
nodes. Vehicle path overlap rate without a planned path is set to the mean

predict future traffic conditions on the basis of road networks and traffic
conditions in the past. The problem is typically solved by modeling complex
spatio-temporal correlations in traffic data using spatio-temporal graph neural
networks (GNNs). However, the performance of these methods is still far from
satisfactory since GNNs usually have limited representation capacity when it
comes to complex traffic networks. Graphs, by nature, fall short in capturing
non-pairwise relations. Even worse, existing methods follow the paradigm of
message passing that aggregates neighborhood information linearly, which fails
to capture complicated spatio-temporal high-order interactions. To tackle these
issues, in this paper, we propose a novel model named Dynamic Hypergraph
Structure Learning (DyHSL) for traffic flow prediction. To learn non-pairwise
relationships, our DyHSL extracts hypergraph structural information to model
dynamics in the traffic networks, and updates each node representation by
aggregating messages from its associated hyperedges. Additionally, to capture
high-order spatio-temporal relations in the road network, we introduce an
interactive graph convolution block, which further models the neighborhood
interaction for each node. Finally, we integrate these two views into a
holistic multi-scale correlation extraction module, which conducts temporal
pooling with different scales to model different temporal patterns. Extensive
experiments on four popular traffic benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed DyHSL compared with a broad range of competing
baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12028v1

the crystal orientation of the substrate not only when in direct contact with

series computed in `closed form', i.e., without expansions in the satellite's
orbital eccentricity. These algorithms are provided in the form of a symbolic
package accompanying the present report. The package contains symbolic algebra
programs, as well as explicit data files containing the final Hamiltonian,
equations of motion and transformations (i.e. the coefficients and exponents of
each variable in each term) leading to the averaging of the short-periodic

requires a significant amount of labeled data. This is posing a challenge as
the images are required to be annotated by medical professionals. To address
this limitation, we introduce the Adaptive Locked Agnostic Network (ALAN), a
concept involving self-supervised visual feature extraction using a large
backbone model to produce anatomically robust semantic self-segmentation. In
the ALAN methodology, this self-supervised training occurs only once on a large
and diverse dataset. Due to the intuitive interpretability of the segmentation,
downstream models tailored for specific tasks can be easily designed using
white-box models with few parameters. This, in turn, opens up the possibility
of communicating the inner workings of a model with domain experts and
introducing prior knowledge into it. It also means that the downstream models
become less data-hungry compared to fully supervised approaches. These
characteristics make ALAN particularly well-suited for resource-scarce
scenarios, such as costly clinical trials and rare diseases. In this paper, we
apply the ALAN approach to three publicly available echocardiography datasets:
EchoNet-Dynamic, CAMUS, and TMED-2. Our findings demonstrate that the
self-supervised backbone model robustly identifies anatomical subregions of the
heart in an apical four-chamber view. Building upon this, we design two
downstream models, one for segmenting a target anatomical region, and a second
for echocardiogram view classification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11899v1

worse than learning from scratch when directly applied to medical images whose
downstream tasks are usually segmentation. In this work, we propose a novel
asymmetric contrastive learning framework named JCL for medical image
segmentation with self-supervised pre-training. Specifically, (1) A novel
asymmetric contrastive learning strategy is proposed to pre-train both encoder

segmentation models. (2) A multi-level contrastive loss is designed to take the
correspondence among feature-level, image-level and pixel-level projections,

become a powerful tool for system identification. This paper presents a
physics-informed Gaussian process (GP) model for Timoshenko beam elements. The
model is constructed as a multi-output GP with covariance and cross-covariance
kernels analytically derived based on the differential equations for
deflections, rotations, strains, bending moments, shear forces and applied
loads. Stiffness identification is performed in a Bayesian format by maximising
a posterior model through a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, yielding a
stochastic model for the structural parameters. The optimised GP model is
further employed for probabilistic predictions of unobserved responses.
Additionally, an entropy-based method for physics-informed sensor placement
optimisation is presented, exploiting heterogeneous sensor position information
and structural boundary conditions built into the GP model. Results demonstrate
that the proposed approach is effective at identifying structural parameters
and is capable of fusing data from heterogeneous and multi-fidelity sensors.
Probabilistic predictions of structural responses and internal forces are in
closer agreement with measured data. We validate our model with an experimental
setup and discuss the quality and uncertainty of the obtained results. The
proposed approach has potential applications in the field of structural health

attention. To weaken projection truncation and image the region of interest
(ROI) for LCT, the backprojection filtration (BPF) algorithm is an effective
solution. However, in BPF for LCT, it is difficult to achieve stable interior
reconstruction, and for differentiated backprojection (DBP) images of LCT,
multiple rotation-finite inversion of Hilbert transform (Hilbert
filtering)-inverse rotation operations will blur the image. To satisfy multiple
reconstruction scenarios for LCT, including interior ROI, complete object, and
exterior region beyond field-of-view (FOV), and avoid the rotation operations
of Hilbert filtering, we propose two types of reconstruction architectures. The
first overlays multiple DBP images to obtain a complete DBP image, then uses a
network to learn the overlying Hilbert filtering function, referred to as the
Overlay-Single Network (OSNet). The second uses multiple networks to train
different directional Hilbert filtering models for DBP images of multiple
linear scannings, respectively, and then overlays the reconstructed results,
i.e., Multiple Networks Overlaying (MNetO). In two architectures, we introduce
a Swin Transformer (ST) block to the generator of pix2pixGAN to extract both
local and global features from DBP images at the same time. We investigate two
architectures from different networks, FOV sizes, pixel sizes, number of
projections, geometric magnification, and processing time. Experimental results
show that two architectures can both recover images. OSNet outperforms BPF in
various scenarios. For the different networks, ST-pix2pixGAN is superior to
pix2pixGAN and CycleGAN. MNetO exhibits a few artifacts due to the differences

extraction and knowledge graph construction. Despite recent advancements,
existing methods still exhibit certain limitations. They just employ
generalized pre-trained models and do not consider the specificity of RTE

task into two subtasks, initially identifying subjects and subsequently
identifying objects and relations. They solely focus on extracting relational
triples from subject to object, neglecting that once the extraction of a
subject fails, it fails in extracting all triples associated with that subject.
To address these issues, we propose BitCoin, an innovative Bidirectional
tagging and supervised Contrastive learning based joint relational triple
extraction framework. Specifically, we design a supervised contrastive learning
method that considers multiple positives per anchor rather than restricting it
to just one positive. Furthermore, a penalty term is introduced to prevent
excessive similarity between the subject and object. Our framework implements
taggers in two directions, enabling triples extraction from subject to object

ignoring its local and global fluency in the context and original utterance. To
maintain the speech fluency, we propose a fluency speech editing model, termed

resources (DERs), such as electric cars, storage batteries, wind turbines and
photovoltaics (PV), can be connected and integrated for reliable energy

to evaluate model privacy risk under reconstruction attacks. Under these
metrics, reconstructed images that are determined to resemble the original one
generally indicate more privacy leakage. Images determined as overall
dissimilar, on the other hand, indicate higher robustness against attack.
However, there is no guarantee that these metrics well reflect human opinions,
which, as a judgement for model privacy leakage, are more trustworthy. In this
paper, we comprehensively study the faithfulness of these hand-crafted metrics
to human perception of privacy information from the reconstructed images. On 5
datasets ranging from natural images, faces, to fine-grained classes, we use 4
existing attack methods to reconstruct images from many different
classification models and, for each reconstructed image, we ask multiple human
annotators to assess whether this image is recognizable. Our studies reveal
that the hand-crafted metrics only have a weak correlation with the human
evaluation of privacy leakage and that even these metrics themselves often
contradict each other. These observations suggest risks of current metrics in
the community. To address this potential risk, we propose a learning-based
measure called SemSim to evaluate the Semantic Similarity between the original
and reconstructed images. SemSim is trained with a standard triplet loss, using
an original image as an anchor, one of its recognizable reconstructed images as
a positive sample, and an unrecognizable one as a negative. By training on
human annotations, SemSim exhibits a greater reflection of privacy leakage on
the semantic level. We show that SemSim has a significantly higher correlation
with human judgment compared with existing metrics. Moreover, this strong

which covers crack initiation and propagation with limited input parameters, is
embedded in a robust and efficient numerical framework for simulating
progressive failure in composite laminates under fatigue loading. The fatigue
cohesive zone model is enhanced with an implicit time integration scheme of the
fatigue damage variable which allows for larger cycle increments and more
efficient analyses. The method is combined with an adaptive strategy for
determining the cycle increment based on global convergence rates. Moreover, a
consistent material tangent stiffness matrix has been derived by fully
linearizing the underlying mixed-mode quasi-static model and the fatigue damage
update. The enhanced fatigue cohesive zone model is used to describe matrix
cracking and delamination in laminates. In order to allow for matrix cracks to
initiate at arbitrary locations and to avoid complex and costly mesh
generation, the phantom node version of the eXtended finite element method

crack insertion criterion is presented, which is consistent with the fatigue
cohesive zone formulation. It is shown with numerical examples that the
improved fatigue damage update enhances the accuracy, efficiency and robustness

model trainability. Our privacy framework centers on the complexity of solving
the system of high-degree multivariate Chebyshev polynomials generated by the
gradients of quantum circuit. We present compelling arguments highlighting the
inherent difficulty in solving these equations, both in exact and approximate
scenarios. Additionally, we delve into machine learning-based attack strategies
and establish a direct connection between overparameterization in the original
federated learning model and underparameterization in the attack model.
Furthermore, we provide numerical scaling arguments showcasing that
underparameterization of the expressive map in the attack model leads to the
loss landscape being swamped with exponentially many spurious local minima
points, thus making it extremely hard to realize a successful attack. This
provides a strong claim, for the first time, that the nature of quantum machine
learning models inherently helps prevent data leakage in federated learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13002v1

a function of spacing between the control condensates. Our ideas may be

characterized by the conversion of free energy into useful work at the

understand the nature of their nonequilibrium states. The entropy production
rate and the magnitude of the steady-state probability current provide
quantitative ways to do so by measuring the breakdown of time-reversal symmetry
and the strength of nonequilibrium transport of measure. Yet, their efficient
computation has remained elusive, as they depend on the system's unknown and
high-dimensional probability density. Here, building upon recent advances in
generative modeling, we develop a deep learning framework that estimates the
score of this density. We show that the score, together with the microscopic
equations of motion, gives direct access to the entropy production rate, the

individual particles, spatial regions, and degrees of freedom. To represent the

four zones, PZ (peripheral zone), TZ (transition zone), DPU (distal prostatic

boundary with the others and is present in every slice. Further, the
representations captured by a single model might not suffice for all zones.
This motivated us to design a dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN),
where each branch captures the representations of the connected zones

complementary to each other at the second stage of training, where they are
fine-tuned through an unsupervised loss. The loss penalises the difference in

the network when it is the seed of spreading. Combining nodal properties

In this work, we investigate to what extent local and global topological
information around a node contributes to the prediction of nodal influence and
whether relatively local information is sufficient for the prediction. We show
that by leveraging the iterative process used to derives a classical nodal
centrality such as eigenvector centrality, we can define an iterative metric
set that progressively incorporates more global information around the node. We
propose to predict nodal influence using an iterative metric set that consists
of an iterative metric from order $1$ to $K$ that are produced in an iterative
process, encoding gradually more global information as $K$ increases. Three
iterative metrics are considered, which converge to three classical node
centrality metrics respectively. Our results show that for each of the three
iterative metrics, the prediction quality is close to optimal when the metric
of relatively low orders ($K\sim4$) are included and increases only marginally
when further increasing $K$. The best performing iterative metric set shows
comparable prediction quality to the benchmark that combines seven centrality

an event contains other events as its arguments recursively. Nested events
involve a kind of Pivot Elements (PEs) that simultaneously act as arguments of
outer events and as triggers of inner events, and thus connect them into nested

NEE methods, as they cannot well cope with the dual identities of PEs.
Therefore, this paper proposes a new model, called PerNee, which extracts
nested events mainly based on recognizing PEs. Specifically, PerNee first
recognizes the triggers of both inner and outer events and further recognizes
the PEs via classifying the relation type between trigger pairs. In order to
obtain better representations of triggers and arguments to further improve NEE
performance, it incorporates the information of both event types and argument
roles into PerNee through prompt learning. Since existing NEE datasets (e.g.,
Genia11) are limited to specific domains and contain a narrow range of event
types with nested structures, we systematically categorize nested events in

However, these methods require paired scans of hard and soft reconstruction
kernels that are spatially and anatomically aligned. Additionally, a large

localize objects using only image-level labels. Recently, a new paradigm has
emerged by generating a foreground prediction map (FPM) to achieve pixel-level
localization. While existing FPM-based methods use cross-entropy to evaluate
the foreground prediction map and to guide the learning of the generator, this
paper presents two astonishing experimental observations on the object
localization learning process: For a trained network, as the foreground mask
expands, 1) the cross-entropy converges to zero when the foreground mask covers
only part of the object region. 2) The activation value continuously increases
until the foreground mask expands to the object boundary. Therefore, to achieve
a more effective localization performance, we argue for the usage of activation
value to learn more object regions. In this paper, we propose a Background
Activation Suppression (BAS) method. Specifically, an Activation Map Constraint

the background activation value. Meanwhile, by using foreground region guidance

attention in nanophotonics because of their directional propagation at the
nanoscale, which offer unique possibilities for nanooptical applications.
However, exploiting the full potential of anisotropic polaritons requires a
thorough understanding of their properties, including field confinement, energy
and phase propagation direction and losses. Here we fill this critical gap by
providing fundamental insights into the propagation of anisotropic polaritons
in thin biaxial layers. In particular, we introduce a novel methodology that
allows us to represent isofrequency curves of polaritons in strongly
anisotropic materials considering that the real and imaginary parts of the
wavevector are not parallel. In fact, we analytically show that the direction
of the imaginary part of the wavevector is parallel to the group velocity, and
thus to the propagation direction and that the group velocity and the phase
velocity can have different directions. This finding is crucial for accurately
predicting polaritonic phenomena in anisotropic media and for the
interpretation of experimental results, yet it has so far been widely
overlooked in the literature, where it is customary to assume that the real and
imaginary parts of the wavevector are parallel. Additionally, we introduce a
criterion for classifying the polaritonic modes in biaxial layers into volume
and surface categories, and analyze their dispersion, field structure, and
losses. Finally, we discover the existence of anisotropic TE modes, which can
exhibit natural canalization. Taken together, our results shed light on
hitherto unexplored areas of the theory of electromagnetic modes in thin

crack propagation is affected by mesoscale heterogeneities taking the form of
an array of inclusions. Using a variational phase-field approach, we compute
the apparent crack speed and fracture energy dissipation rate to compare crack
propagation under Mode-I loading across different configurations of these
inclusions. If fixing the volume fraction of inclusions, matching the inclusion
size to the K-dominance zone size gives rise to the best toughening outcome.
Conversely, if varying the volume fraction of inclusions, a lower volume
fraction configuration can lead to a better toughening outcome if and only if
the inclusion size approaches from above the size of the K-dominance zone.
Since the size of the K-dominance zone can be estimated \textit{a priori} given
an understanding of the application scenario and material availability, we can,
in principle, exploit this estimation to design a material's mesoscale
heterogeneity that optimally balances the tradeoff between strength and
toughness. This paves the way for realizing functional (meta-)materials against
crack propagation in extreme environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12916v1

adversarial attacks have increased against voice-based technologies, developing
solutions robust to such attacks has become crucial. In this work, we propose
VIC-KD, a robust distillation recipe for model compression and adversarial
robustness. Using self-supervised speech representations, we show that imposing
geometric priors to the latent representations of both Teacher and Student

third-generation leptons while its couplings to first and second-generation
leptons are naturally suppressed. Furthermore, only $S_1$ in the scalar LQ
models has the feature that down-type quarks merely couple to neutrinos but not
the charged leptons, avoiding strict restrictions from $b\to s \mu^+ \mu^-$.
With this distinctive characteristic of $S_1$, we investigate its impact on
rare processes involving the $d_i \to d_j \nu \bar\nu$ transitions. Under the

biharmonic 3D shape deformation. Control-point-based 3D deformation methods are
widely utilized for interactive shape editing, and their usability is enhanced
when the control points are sparse yet strategically distributed across the

can determine the most suitable set of control points, assuming that we have a
given set of possible shape variations. The challenges associated with this
task primarily stem from the computationally demanding nature of the problem.
Two main factors contribute to this complexity: solving a large linear system

of finding the optimal subset of mesh vertices. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a reformulation of the biharmonic computation that reduces the
matrix size, making it dependent on the number of control points rather than

Kappa Carrageenan and Iota Carrageenan undergo a three-dimensional gel network
structure formation or dissociation with a change in temperature. During the
sol-gel and gel-sol transitions, the Carrageenan systems pass through a unique
critical gel state, where dynamic moduli are scale-invariant owing to the
self-similar structure of the three-dimensional network. In this work, we
obtain the critical gel state associated with pure and mixed systems of Kappa
and Iota Carrageenan during cooling and heating by exploring the material
behavior for a range of frequencies. Interestingly, on the one hand, the mixed
gels show a higher critical sol-gel transition temperature compared to the pure
systems at equal individual concentrations. On the other hand, the low
temperature moduli of mixed gels are closer to that of Kappa Carrageenan when
the concentration of the same is more than half in the mixture. The rheological
measurements demonstrate that the Kappa Carrageenan strongly affects the nature
of aggregation of double helices of Iota Carrageenan, but Iota Carrageenan does
not have a significant influence on that of Kappa Carrageenan. These results

independent sets, or colourings -- are of fundamental importance in classical
complexity. It is well motivated to consider similar problems about quantum
graphs, which are an operator system generalisation of graphs. Defining
well-formulated decision problems for quantum graphs faces several technical
challenges, and consequently the connections between quantum graphs and
complexity have been underexplored.
  In this work, we introduce and study the clique problem for quantum graphs.
Our approach utilizes a well-known connection between quantum graphs and
quantum channels. The inputs for our problems are presented as quantum channels
induced by circuits, which implicitly determine a corresponding quantum graph.
We also use this approach to reimagine the clique and independent set problems
for classical graphs, by taking the inputs to be circuits of deterministic or
noisy channels which implicitly determine confusability graphs. We show that,
by varying the collection of channels in the language, these give rise to
complete problems for the classes $\textsf{NP}$, $\textsf{MA}$, $\textsf{QMA}$,
and $\textsf{QMA}(2)$. In this way, we exhibit a classical complexity problem
whose natural quantisation is $\textsf{QMA}(2)$, rather than $\textsf{QMA}$,
which is commonly assumed.
  To prove the results in the quantum case, we make use of methods inspired by
self-testing. To illustrate the utility of our techniques, we include a new
proof of the reduction of $\textsf{QMA}(k)$ to $\textsf{QMA}(2)$ via cliques
for quantum graphs. We also study the complexity of a version of the
independent set problem for quantum graphs, and provide preliminary evidence
that it may be in general weaker in complexity, contrasting to the classical

periodically driven Rice-Mele model, a prototypical realization of the Thouless
pump. Although the pump is robust against disorder in the fully adiabatic

relevant also in light of recent experimental realizations. We find that at any
fixed period time and nonzero disorder, increasing the system size $L\to\infty$
always leads to a breakdown of the pump, indicating Anderson localization of
the Floquet states. Our numerics indicate, however, that in a properly defined
thermodynamic limit, where $L/T^\theta$ is kept constant, Anderson localization
can be avoided, and the charge pumped per cycle has a well-defined value -- as
long as the disorder is not too strong. The critical exponent $\theta$ is not
universal, rather, its value depends on the disorder strength. Our findings are
relevant for practical, experimental realizations of the Thouless pump, for

AiT induces low-rank explicit memory that serves as both priors to guide
bottleneck attention in the shared workspace and attractors within associative
memory of a Hopfield network. Through joint end-to-end training, these priors
naturally develop module specialization, each contributing a distinct inductive
bias to form attention bottlenecks. A bottleneck can foster competition among
inputs for writing information into the memory. We show that AiT is a sparse
representation learner, learning distinct priors through the bottlenecks that
are complexity-invariant to input quantities and dimensions. AiT demonstrates
its superiority over methods such as the Set Transformer, Vision Transformer,

nature of their tasks, exhibit high variability in execution, with variable
outcomes. The introduction of robotic automation for most complex processing
tasks has been challenging due to current robot learning policies. A more
consistent learning policy involving skilled operators is desired. In this
paper, we address the problem of robot learning when presented with

configuration and forces exerted on the object in order to achieve effective

a camera, which is important for applications, such as robot navigation and
self-driving. Traditional frame-based methods suffer from performance drops due
to the limited dynamic range and motion blur. Therefore, recent works leverage
novel event cameras to complement or guide the frame modality via frame-event
feature fusion. However, event streams exhibit spatial sparsity, leaving some
areas unperceived, especially in regions with marginal light changes.
Therefore, direct fusion methods, e.g., RAMNet, often ignore the contribution
of the most confident regions of each modality. This leads to structural
ambiguity in the modality fusion process, thus degrading the depth estimation
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial Reliability-oriented
Fusion Network (SRFNet), that can estimate depth with fine-grained structure at
both daytime and nighttime. Our method consists of two key technical
components. Firstly, we propose an attention-based interactive fusion (AIF)
module that applies spatial priors of events and frames as the initial masks
and learns the consensus regions to guide the inter-modal feature fusion. The
fused feature are then fed back to enhance the frame and event feature
learning. Meanwhile, it utilizes an output head to generate a fused mask, which
is iteratively updated for learning consensual spatial priors. Secondly, we
propose the Reliability-oriented Depth Refinement (RDR) module to estimate
dense depth with the fine-grained structure based on the fused features and
masks. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on the synthetic and
real-world datasets, which shows that, even without pretraining, our method
outperforms the prior methods, e.g., RAMNet, especially in night scenes. Our

exchange interaction, varying the explicit hole doping and the treatment of the
Nd $4f$ electrons. The $U$-$J$ phase diagrams for undoped nickelates and
cuprates indicate $G$-type ordering, yet show different $U$ dependency. By
either Sr hole doping or explicit treatment of the Nd $4f$ electrons, we find a
transition to a Ni $C$-type AFM ground state. We trace the effect of Sr doping
back to a distinct accommodation of the holes by the Ni versus Cu $e_g$
orbitals. The interaction between Nd $4f$ and Ni $3d$ states stabilizes
$C$-type AFM order on both sublattices. Though spin-orbit interactions induce a

development of secure Internet of Remote Things (IoRT). In scenarios with
miniaturized terminals, the limited transmission power and long transmission
distance often lead to low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the satellite
receiver, which degrades communication performance. A solution to address this
issue is the utilization of cooperative satellites, which can combine signals
received from multiple satellites, thereby significantly improve SNR. However,
in order to maximize the combination gain, the signal coherent combining is
necessary, which requires the carrier frequency and phase of each receiving
signal to be aligned.
  Under low SNR circumstances, carrier parameter estimation can be a
significant challenge, especially for short burst transmission with no training
sequence. In order to tackle it, we propose an iterative code-aided estimation
algorithm for joint Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) and Carrier Phase Offset
(CPO). The Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) is suggested as the limit on the
parameter estimation performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm can approach Bit Error Rate (BER) performance bound within

(CMR) imaging remains a demanding task in clinical practice. Purpose: Existing
approaches to its automation relied either on an additional volumetric image
not typically acquired in clinic routine, or on laborious manual annotations of
cardiac structural landmarks. This work presents a clinic-compatible,
annotation-free system for automatic CMR view planning. Methods: The system
mines the spatial relationship, more specifically, locates the intersecting
lines, between the target planes and source views, and trains deep networks to
regress heatmaps defined by distances from the intersecting lines. The
intersection lines are the prescription lines prescribed by the technologists
at the time of image acquisition using cardiac landmarks, and retrospectively
identified from the spatial relationship. As the spatial relationship is
self-contained in properly stored data, the need for additional manual
annotation is eliminated. In addition, the interplay of multiple target planes
predicted in a source view is utilized in a stacked hourglass architecture to
gradually improve the regression. Then, a multi-view planning strategy is
proposed to aggregate information from the predicted heatmaps for all the
source views of a target plane, for a globally optimal prescription, mimicking
the similar strategy practiced by skilled human prescribers. Results: The
experiments include 181 CMR exams. Our system yields the mean angular
difference and point-to-plane distance of 5.68 degrees and 3.12 mm,

depended on by hundreds of millions of people. Unfortunately, most coral reefs
are existentially threatened by global climate change and local anthropogenic
pressures. To better understand the dynamics underlying deterioration of reefs,
monitoring at high spatial and temporal resolution is key. However,
conventional monitoring methods for quantifying coral cover and species
abundance are limited in scale due to the extensive manual labor required.
Although computer vision tools have been employed to aid in this process, in
particular SfM photogrammetry for 3D mapping and deep neural networks for image
segmentation, analysis of the data products creates a bottleneck, effectively
limiting their scalability. This paper presents a new paradigm for mapping
underwater environments from ego-motion video, unifying 3D mapping systems that
use machine learning to adapt to challenging conditions under water, combined
with a modern approach for semantic segmentation of images. The method is
exemplified on coral reefs in the northern Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea,
demonstrating high-precision 3D semantic mapping at unprecedented scale with
significantly reduced required labor costs: a 100 m video transect acquired
within 5 minutes of diving with a cheap consumer-grade camera can be fully
automatically analyzed within 5 minutes. Our approach significantly scales up
coral reef monitoring by taking a leap towards fully automatic analysis of
video transects. The method democratizes coral reef transects by reducing the
labor, equipment, logistics, and computing cost. This can help to inform
conservation policies more efficiently. The underlying computational method of
learning-based Structure-from-Motion has broad implications for fast low-cost

magnetic properties have not been well explored. A recent study by Nirmal Roy
et al. [1] showed that a collection of Co$_2$C NPs exhibit an exchange bias
(EB) effect below T$_{EB}$ = 50 K and also a spin glass (SG) state below
T$_{SG}$ = 5 K. We use magnetic, electrical transport, specific heat, and muon
spin rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements to explore further the magnetic properties
of these NPs. We uncover the onset of Kondo localization at Kondo temperature
T$_K$ (= 40.1 K), near the onset of EB effect. A crossover from the
Kondo-screened scenario to an RKKY interaction-dominated regime is also
observed for T < T$_K$. Specific heat measurements confirm Kondo localization
and heavy fermionic nature in Co$_2$C at low T. At low T, zero field $\mu$SR
spectra reveal a dominant magnetically disordered fraction with slow relaxation
and a smaller fraction with short-range order exhibiting fast relaxation, with
no evidence of long-range magnetic order. We observe an increase in this fast
relaxation rate between T$_{EB}$ and T$_{SG}$, suggesting a slowing down of the
fluctuating local magnetic environment around muons. Transverse field $\mu$SR
spectra show the emergence of a stable, multi-peaked local magnetic field
distribution below T$_{EB}$. Longitudinal field $\mu$SR spectra shows distinct
changes in the dynamics of fluctuations suggesting the presence of a frozen
glassy like state below 6 K. Our results suggest that below T$_{EB}$, Co$_2$C
NPs pellet develops a magnetic interface, separating disordered and short-range
order fractions. The Exchange interaction that sets in below T$_{EB}$ at the
interface couples them and suppresses the fluctuations. With the suppression of
magnetic fluctuations below T$_{EB}$, strong correlation effects in the

operator in order to assist in data processing and obtain reliable results

quality control (QC) approach of a dynamic 31P-MRS protocol. Part two is an
impact study demonstrating the added value of the QC approach to explore
clinical results derived from two patient populations with significant fatigue:
COVID19 and multiple sclerosis (MS). Experimental: 31P-MRS was performed on a
3T clinical MRI in 175 subjects from clinical and healthy control populations
conducted in a University Hospital. An advanced data QC Score (QCS) was
developed using multiple objective criteria. The criteria were based on current
recommendations from the literature enriched by new proposals based on clinical
experience. The QCS was designed to indicate valid and corrupt data and guide
necessary objective data editing to extract as much valid physiological data as
possible. Dynamic acquisitions using an MR-compatible ergometer ran over a
rest(40s), exercise(2min), and a recovery phase(6min). Results: Using QCS
enabled rapid identification of subjects with data anomalies allowing the user
to correct the data series or reject them partially or entirely as well as
identify fully valid datasets. Overall, the use of the QCS resulted in the
automatic classification of 45% of the subjects including 58 participants that
had data with no criterion violation and 21 participants with violations that
resulted in the rejection of all dynamic data. The remaining datasets were
inspected manually with guidance allowing acceptance of full datasets from an
additional 80 participants and recovery phase data from an additional 16
subjects. Overall, more anomalies occurred with patient data (35% of datasets)
compared to healthy controls (15% of datasets). Conclusion: This paper
describes typical difficulties encountered during the dynamic acquisition of
31P-MRS. Based on these observations, a standardized data quality control
pipeline was created and implemented in both healthy and patient populations.
The QC scoring ensures a standardized data rejection procedure and rigorous
objective analysis of dynamic 31P-MRS data obtained from patients. The

efficient simulation of such non-deterministic quantum error correcting
protocols for any type of quantum circuit and incoherent noise of low strength.
As an importance sampling technique, dynamical subset sampling allows one to
effectively make use of computational resources to only sample the most
relevant sequences of quantum circuits in order to estimate a protocol's
logical failure rate with well-defined error bars. We demonstrate the
capabilities of dynamical subset sampling with examples from fault-tolerant

cometary dust tails have long been studied to obtain information on the dust
properties, such as characteristic particle size and initial velocity when
entering the tail. Over the past two decades, several spacecraft missions to
comets have enabled us to study the dust activity of their targets at much
greater resolution than is possible with a telescope on Earth or in near-Earth
space, and added detail to the results obtained by the spacecraft visiting
comet 1P/Halley in 1986. We now know that the dynamics of dust in the inner
cometary coma is complex and includes a significant fraction of particles that
will eventually fall back to the surface. The filamented structure of the
near-surface coma is thought to result from a combination of topographic
focussing of the gas flow, inhomogeneous distribution of activity across the
surface, and projection effects. It is possible that some
larger-than-centimetre debris contains ice when lifted from the surface, which
can affect its motion. Open questions remain regarding the microphysics of the
process that leads to the detachment and lifting of dust from the surface, the
evolution of the dust while travelling away from the nucleus, and the extent to
which information on the nucleus activity can be retrieved from remote
observations of the outer coma and tail.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12759v1

processes on networks exhibiting higher-order structures, such as simplicial
complexes, where the dynamics acts above and beyond dyadic interactions. Using
simulations or heuristically derived epidemic spreading models it was shown
that new phenomena can emerge, such as bi-stability/multistability. Here, we
show that such new emerging phenomena do not require complex contact patterns,
such as community structures, but naturally result from the higher-order
contagion mechanisms. We show this by deriving an exact higher-order SIS model
and its limiting mean-field equivalent for fully connected simplicial
complexes. Going beyond previous results, we also give the global bifurcation
picture for networks with 3- and 4-body interactions, with the latter allowing
for two non-trivial stable endemic steady states. Differently from previous
approaches, we are able to study systems featuring interactions of arbitrary
order. In addition, we characterise the contributions from higher-order
infections to the endemic equilibrium as perturbations of the pairwise
baseline, finding that these diminish as the pairwise rate of infection
increases. Our approach represents a first step towards a principled
understanding of higher-order contagion processes beyond triads and opens up
further directions for analytical investigations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12752v1

out-of-equilibrium Statistical Physics that serves as a simplistic model for

parking in many metropolises, we introduce a variant of TASEP, dubbed SFP, in
which particles are initially cruising at a slower speed and aiming to park on
one of the sites adjacent to the main road, described by a unidimensional
lattice. After parking, they pull out at a finite rate and move at a normal
speed. We show that this model, which breaks many of the conservation rules
applicable in other TASEP variants, exhibits singular features, in particular
non-monotonic variations of the steady-state current with the injection rate
and re-entrant transitions in the phase diagram, for some range of parameters.
These features are robust to variations in the update rule and the boundary
conditions.Neither the slow speed of cruising cars nor the perturbation of the
flow due to pull-out maneuvers, taken in isolation, can rationalize these
observations. Instead, they originate in a cramming (or `paper jam') effect
which results from the coupling of these mechanisms: injecting too many cars
into the system saturates the first sites of the road, which prevents parked
cars from pulling out, thus forcing cruising cars to travel farther along the

represented by networks is a problem of long research interest, and a most
fundamental and widespread property of social networks related to cooperation
phenomena is that the node's degree (i.e., number of edges connected to the
node) is heterogeneously distributed. Previous results indicate that static
heterogeneous (i.e., degree-heterogeneous) networks promote cooperation in
stationarity compared to static regular (i.e., degree-homogeneous) networks if
equilibrium dynamics starting from many cooperators and defectors is employed.
However, the above conclusion reverses if we employ non-equilibrium stochastic
processes to measure the fixation probability for cooperation, i.e., the
probability that a single cooperator successfully invades a population. Here we
resolve this conundrum by analyzing the fixation of cooperation on temporal
(i.e., time-varying) networks. We theoretically prove and numerically confirm
that on both synthetic and empirical networks, contrary to the case of static
networks, temporal heterogeneous networks can promote cooperation more than
temporal regular networks in terms of the fixation probability of cooperation.

position of objects precisely. However, it is also a time-consuming process
that needs to be repeated for every displacement of the cameras. The standard
approach is to use a printed pattern with known geometry to estimate the
intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the cameras. The same idea can be applied
to event-based cameras, though it requires extra work. By using frame
reconstruction from events, a printed pattern can be detected. A blinking
pattern can also be displayed on a screen. Then, the pattern can be directly
detected from the events. Such calibration methods can provide accurate
intrinsic calibration for both frame- and event-based cameras. However, using
2D patterns has several limitations for multi-camera extrinsic calibration,
with cameras possessing highly different points of view and a wide baseline.
The 2D pattern can only be detected from one direction and needs to be of
significant size to compensate for its distance to the camera. This makes the
extrinsic calibration time-consuming and cumbersome. To overcome these

The key findings for each aspect are as follows: (1) statisticians make
extensive use of visualization during all phases of their work (and not just
when reporting results); (2) their mental models of inferential methods tend to
be mostly visually based; and (3) many statisticians abhor dichotomous

multiplying the Fisher divergence with a constant, which leads to robust error
control and ensures the stability and precision of the algorithm. Our

the effectiveness and the faster convergence rate of the proposed method. We
achieve a classification accuracy of 93.56 on the CIFAR10 dataset,
outperforming SOTA Gaussian process methods. Furthermore, our method guarantees

particularly due to the widespread dissemination of multi-modal manipulations
on the internet, which has resulted in numerous negative impacts on society.
Existing methods for multi-modal manipulation detection and grounding primarily
focus on fusing vision-language features to make predictions, while overlooking
the importance of modality-specific features, leading to sub-optimal results.
In this paper, we construct a simple and novel transformer-based framework for
multi-modal manipulation detection and grounding tasks. Our framework
simultaneously explores modality-specific features while preserving the
capability for multi-modal alignment. To achieve this, we introduce
visual/language pre-trained encoders and dual-branch cross-attention (DCA) to
extract and fuse modality-unique features. Furthermore, we design decoupled
fine-grained classifiers (DFC) to enhance modality-specific feature mining and
mitigate modality competition. Moreover, we propose an implicit manipulation
query (IMQ) that adaptively aggregates global contextual cues within each
modality using learnable queries, thereby improving the discovery of forged
details. Extensive experiments on the $\rm DGM^4$ dataset demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed model compared to state-of-the-art

the average cosine similarity between the embeddings of adjacent utterances.
Results showed that semantic similarity had a positive association with wives'
affect during conflict (but not pleasant) conversations. Moreover, this
association was not observed with husbands' affect regardless of conversation
types. Two validation checks further provided support for the validity of the

computerized models for the detection of COVID-19 using CT imaging. A novel

the CT-based diagnosis of COVID-19. Given the lower specificity of traditional
features in distinguishing between different causes of pulmonary diseases, the
objective of this study is to develop a CT-based radiomics framework for the
differentiation of COVID-19 from other lung diseases. The model is designed to
focus on outlining COVID-19 lesions, as traditional features often lack

teammates. Classical multi-agent learning approaches train agents that can only
coordinate with seen teammates. Recent studies attempted to generate diverse
teammates to enhance the generalizable coordination ability, but were
restricted by pre-defined teammates. In this work, our aim is to train agents
with strong coordination ability by generating teammates that fully cover the
teammate policy space, so that agents can coordinate with any teammates. Since
the teammate policy space is too huge to be enumerated, we find only dissimilar
teammates that are incompatible with controllable agents, which highly reduces
the number of teammates that need to be trained with. However, it is hard to
determine the number of such incompatible teammates beforehand. We therefore
introduce a continual multi-agent learning process, in which the agent learns
to coordinate with different teammates until no more incompatible teammates can
be found. The above idea is implemented in the proposed Macop (Multi-agent
compatible policy learning) algorithm. We conduct experiments in 8 scenarios
from 4 environments that have distinct coordination patterns. Experiments show
that Macop generates training teammates with much lower compatibility than
previous methods. As a result, in all scenarios Macop achieves the best overall

eigenvalues of the Choi matrix corresponding to the channel have a special

resultant noisy estimate of the channel can then be denoised by diagonalizing
the nominal Choi matrix, truncating some eigenvalues, and altering it to a

preserve the components that follow the control signals of sequential actions,
so the agent can be induced to learn the robust representation against
distractions. We conduct extensive experiments on the DeepMind Control suite

flexible cylindrical cantilever beam at subcritical Reynolds numbers ($Re$). A
fully-coupled fluid-structure solver based on the three-dimensional (3D)
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is
employed to numerically examine the coupled dynamics of the beam. We assess the
extent to which such a flexible cylindrical beam could sustain oscillations in
this $Re$ regime when it is either exposed to a steady upstream wake (i.e.,
tandem cylinder configuration) or subjected to an externally applied base
excitation. Our results indicate that within a particular range of reduced
velocity parameter ($U^*$), the beam experiences sustained oscillations in both
scenarios, leading to periodic vortex shedding downstream. The mechanism
governing the sustained oscillations is characterized as synchronization,
during which the frequency of the cross-flow fluid loading matches the beam's
first-mode natural frequency. When the beam is subjected to base excitation,
the critical Reynolds number for vortex shedding ($Re_{c}$) is found to reduce
to $Re_{c}\approx5$. Above this threshold, vortex shedding is found to occur by
stimulating the pair of counter-rotating vortices in the near-wake region. For
the tandem cylinder configuration, the beam is shown to exhibit
figure-eight-shaped tip motion trajectories during its oscillatory response.
However, various patterns of tip motion trajectories, including figure-eight,
and chaotic-type responses, are observed when the beam is under external base
excitation. The findings of this work aim to generalize our understanding of
sustained oscillation in flexible cylindrical cantilevers and have relevance to
the development of bio-inspired cantilever flow sensors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12580v1

ET data. This classifier (VTNet) uses a GRU and a CNN in parallel to leverage
both visual (V) and temporal (T) representations of ET data and was previously
used to detect user confusion while processing visual displays. A main
challenge in applying VTNet to our target AD classification task is that the
available ET data sequences are much longer than those used in the previous
confusion detection task, pushing the limits of what is manageable by
LSTM-based models. We discuss how we address this challenge and show that VTNet
outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in AD classification, providing

discrete transitions. As typical in dynamical analysis, an essential goal is to
study the long-term behavior of these systems. In this work, we present two
different novel approaches for studying these systems. The first approach is
based on constructing an analog of the Frobenius-Perron (transport) operator
for hybrid systems. Rather than tracking the evolution of a single trajectory,
this operator encodes the asymptotic nature of an ensemble of trajectories. The
second approach presented applies to an important subclass of hybrid systems,
mechanical impact systems. We develop an analog of Lie-Poisson(-Suslov)
reduction for left-invariant impact systems on Lie groups. In addition to the
Hamiltonian (and constraints) being left-invariant, the impact surface must
also be a right coset of a normal subgroup. This procedure allows a reduction
from a $2n$-dimensional system to an $(n+1)$-dimensional one. We conclude the

multi-disciplinary applications. Previous studies mainly consider the
coalescence of miscible liquid, even though the coalescence of immiscible
droplets on a solid surface is a common process. In this study, we explore the
coalescence of two immiscible droplets on a partial wetting surface
experimentally and theoretically. We find that the coalescence process can be
divided into three stages based on the timescales and force interactions
involved, namely (I) the growth of the liquid bridge, (II) the oscillation of
the coalescing sessile droplet, and (III) the formation of a partially-engulfed
compound sessile droplet and the subsequent retraction. In stage I, the
immiscible interface is found not to affect the scaling of the temporal
evolution of the liquid bridge, which follows the same 2/3 power law as that of
miscible droplets. In Stage II, by developing a new capillary timescale
considering both surface and interfacial tensions, we show that the interfacial
tension between the two immiscible liquids functions as a nonnegligible
resistance to the oscillation which decreases the oscillation periods. In Stage
III, a modified Ohnesorge number is developed to characterize the
visco-capillary and inertia-capillary timescales involved during the
displacement of water by oil; a new model based on energy balance is proposed
to analyze the maximum retraction velocity, highlighting that the viscous

present a challenging control problem due to their complex multivariable
dynamics. Current controllers for these systems typically rely on
proportional-integral algorithms combined with data tables, which rely on
accurate models and are not adaptive to handle time-varying dynamics or system
uncertainties. This paper proposes a novel adaptive model predictive control
(AMPC) strategy with an associated linear parameter varying (LPV) model for
controlling the engine-driven DFLS. This LPV model is derived from a global
network model, which is trained off-line with data obtained from a general mean
value engine model for two-stroke aviation engines. Different network models,
including multi-layer perceptron, Elman, and radial basis function (RBF), are
evaluated and compared in this study. The results demonstrate that the RBF
model exhibits higher prediction accuracy and robustness in the DFLS
application. Based on the trained RBF model, the proposed AMPC approach
constructs an associated network that directly outputs the LPV model parameters
as an adaptive, robust, and efficient prediction model. The efficiency of the
proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations of a vertical
take-off thrust preparation process for the DFLS. The simulation results
indicate that the proposed AMPC method can effectively control the DFLS thrust

directly modify the readability of any text to an absolute target readability

Therefore, we propose a novel readability-controlled text modification task.
The task requires the generation of 8 versions at various target readability

modification metrics. The baselines for this task use ChatGPT and Llama-2, with
an extension approach introducing a two-step process (generating paraphrases by
passing through the language model twice). The zero-shot approaches are able to
push the readability of the paraphrases in the desired direction but the final

cellular networks and beyond, there is going to be more data bandwidth
available on our roads, but it may be heterogeneous because of limitations like
line of sight, infrastructure, and heterogeneous traffic on the road. This
paper addresses the problem of route planning for autonomous vehicles in urban

novel reinforcement learning solution that prioritizes high bandwidth roads to
meet a vehicles data transfer requirement, while also minimizing driving time.
We compare this approach to traffic-unaware and bandwidth-unaware baselines to

for leveraging large-scale human video datasets in robotic offline RL, based
entirely on learning value functions via temporal-difference learning. We show
that value learning on video datasets learns representations that are more
conducive to downstream robotic offline RL than other approaches for learning

tasks with intricate temporal dependencies. Long timescales required for
solving such tasks can arise from properties of individual neurons
(single-neuron timescale, $\tau$, e.g., membrane time constant in biological
neurons) or recurrent interactions among them (network-mediated timescale).
However, the contribution of each mechanism for optimally solving
memory-dependent tasks remains poorly understood. Here, we train RNNs to solve
$N$-parity and $N$-delayed match-to-sample tasks with increasing memory
requirements controlled by $N$ by simultaneously optimizing recurrent weights
and $\tau$s. We find that for both tasks RNNs develop longer timescales with
increasing $N$, but depending on the learning objective, they use different
mechanisms. Two distinct curricula define learning objectives: sequential
learning of a single-$N$ (single-head) or simultaneous learning of multiple
$N$s (multi-head). Single-head networks increase their $\tau$ with $N$ and are
able to solve tasks for large $N$, but they suffer from catastrophic
forgetting. However, multi-head networks, which are explicitly required to hold
multiple concurrent memories, keep $\tau$ constant and develop longer
timescales through recurrent connectivity. Moreover, we show that the
multi-head curriculum increases training speed and network stability to
ablations and perturbations, and allows RNNs to generalize better to tasks
beyond their training regime. This curriculum also significantly improves
training GRUs and LSTMs for large-$N$ tasks. Our results suggest that adapting

approach to model the thermal evolution of a subduction zone with prescribed
changes in slab geometry over time. Our numerical model approximates the
subduction zone geometry by employing time dependent deformation of a B\'ezier
spline which is used as the slab interface in a finite element discretization
of the Stokes and heat equations. We implement the numerical model using the
FEniCS open source finite element suite and describe the means by which we
compute approximations of the subduction zone velocity, temperature, and
pressure fields. We compute and compare the 3D time evolving numerical model
with its 2D analogy at cross-sections for slabs that evolve to the present-day

2309.12891v1,q-fin.TR,EarnHFT: Efficient Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for High Frequency Trading,2023-09-22 14:25:03+00:00,"High-frequency trading (HFT) uses computer algorithms to make trading
decisions in short time scales (e.g., second-level), which is widely used in
the Cryptocurrency (Crypto) market (e.g., Bitcoin). Reinforcement learning (RL)
in financial research has shown stellar performance on many quantitative
trading tasks. However, most methods focus on low-frequency trading, e.g.,
day-level, which cannot be directly applied to HFT because of two challenges.
First, RL for HFT involves dealing with extremely long trajectories (e.g., 2.4
million steps per month), which is hard to optimize and evaluate. Second, the
dramatic price fluctuations and market trend changes of Crypto make existing
algorithms fail to maintain satisfactory performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose an Efficient hieArchical Reinforcement learNing method
for High Frequency Trading (EarnHFT), a novel three-stage hierarchical RL
framework for HFT. In stage I, we compute a Q-teacher, i.e., the optimal action
value based on dynamic programming, for enhancing the performance and training
efficiency of second-level RL agents. In stage II, we construct a pool of
diverse RL agents for different market trends, distinguished by return rates,
where hundreds of RL agents are trained with different preferences of return
rates and only a tiny fraction of them will be selected into the pool based on
their profitability. In stage III, we train a minute-level router which
dynamically picks a second-level agent from the pool to achieve stable
performance across different markets. Through extensive experiments in various
market trends on Crypto markets in a high-fidelity simulation trading
environment, we demonstrate that EarnHFT significantly outperforms 6
state-of-art baselines in 6 popular financial criteria, exceeding the runner-up
by 30% in profitability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12891v1

orientation selection during nucleation of new grains in a polycrystalline film
growth. An assessment of (heterogeneous) nucleation probability as function of
orientation of both the bottom grain and of the nucleus was developed (using
the concepts of classical nucleation theory). Novel solutions to the
generalized Winterbottom construction were described in cases of very strong
anisotropy and arbitrary orientations. In order to demonstrate the effect on
the film crystallographic texture, a 2D Monte Carlo algorithm for anisotropic
polycrystalline growth was used to simulate growth of films with columnar
microstructure. The effect of strength of anisotropy, the deposition rate and
initial texture were investigated. Results showed that with larger strength of
anisotropy, the nucleation rate is less dependent on the driving force, but
more dependent on the initial texture. With certain initial textures, the
anisotropic nucleation may even be either impossible or having probability
close to one irrespective of the driving force. Depending on the conditions,
the anisotropic nucleation could hasten the evolution towards the
interface-energy minimizing texture or retard it. Based on these insights, a
hypothesis was offered to explain a peculiar texture evolution in
electrodeposited nickel.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12889v1

digital jobs, such as digital influencers, fitness models, and adult models who

experiments involving 1,002 participants, we combined theories from both social
psychology and information systems to investigate perceptions of digital jobs
compared to matched established jobs, and predictors of attitudes toward
digital jobs (e.g., symbolic threat, contact, perceived usefulness). We found
that individuals in digital professions were perceived as less favorably and as
less hard-working than those in matched established jobs. Digital jobs were
also regarded as more threatening to societal values and less useful. The
relation between job type and attitudes toward these jobs was partially
mediated by contact with people working in these jobs, perceived usefulness,
perception of hard-working, and symbolic threat. These effects were consistent
across openness to new experiences, attitudes toward digitalization, political
orientation, and age. Among the nine jobs examined, lecturers were perceived as

attracted significant attention from scientific computing. One of the most
popular numerical methods for solving geometric flows is the so-called BGN
scheme, which was proposed by Barrett, Garcke, and Nurnberg (J. Comput. Phys.,
222 (2007), pp. 441{467), due to its favorable properties (e.g., its
computational efficiency and the good mesh property). However, the BGN scheme
is limited to first-order accuracy in time, and how to develop a higher-order
numerical scheme is challenging. In this paper, we propose a fully discrete,
temporal second-order parametric finite element method, which incorporates a
mesh regularization technique when necessary, for solving geometric flows of
curves. The scheme is constructed based on the BGN formulation and a
semi-implicit Crank-Nicolson leap-frog time stepping discretization as well as
a linear finite element approximation in space. More importantly, we point out
that the shape metrics, such as manifold distance and Hausdorff distance,
instead of function norms, should be employed to measure numerical errors.
Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed BGN-based scheme
is second-order accurate in time in terms of shape metrics. Moreover, by
employing the classical BGN scheme as a mesh regularization technique when
necessary, our proposed second-order scheme exhibits good properties with
respect to the mesh distribution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12875v1

regression estimator under a framework of feedforward neural network. There are
several interesting characteristics for the proposed estimator. First, the loss
function is built upon an estimated maximum likelihood function, who integrates
the information from observed data, as well as the information from data
structure. Consequently, the resulting estimator has desirable optimal
properties, such as efficiency. Second, different from the traditional maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE), the proposed method avoid the specification of the
distribution, hence is flexible to any kind of distribution, such as heavy
tails, multimodal or heterogeneous distribution. Third, the proposed loss
function relies on probabilities rather than direct observations as in least
squares, contributing the robustness in the proposed estimator. Finally, the
proposed loss function involves nonparametric regression function only. This
enables a direct application of existing packages, simplifying the computation
and programming. We establish the large sample property of the proposed
estimator in terms of its excess risk and minimax near-optimal rate. The
theoretical results demonstrate that the proposed estimator is equivalent to
the true MLE in which the density function is known. Our simulation studies
show that the proposed estimator outperforms the existing methods in terms of
prediction accuracy, efficiency and robustness. Particularly, it is comparable
to the true MLE, and even gets better as the sample size increases. This
implies that the adaptive and data-driven loss function from the estimated
density may offer an additional avenue for capturing valuable information. We
further apply the proposed method to four real data examples, resulting in
significantly reduced out-of-sample prediction errors compared to existing
methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12872v1

classification and achieved remarkable results. However, the training of ViT
models requires a considerable number of training samples, while hyperspectral
data, due to its high annotation costs, typically has a relatively small number
of training samples. This contradiction has not been effectively addressed. In
this paper, aiming to solve this problem, we propose the single-direction
tuning (SDT) strategy, which serves as a bridge, allowing us to leverage
existing labeled HSI datasets even RGB datasets to enhance the performance on
new HSI datasets with limited samples. The proposed SDT inherits the idea of
prompt tuning, aiming to reuse pre-trained models with minimal modifications
for adaptation to new tasks. But unlike prompt tuning, SDT is custom-designed
to accommodate the characteristics of HSIs. The proposed SDT utilizes a
parallel architecture, an asynchronous cold-hot gradient update strategy, and
unidirectional interaction. It aims to fully harness the potent representation
learning capabilities derived from training on heterologous, even cross-modal
datasets. In addition, we also introduce a novel Triplet-structured transformer
(Tri-Former), where spectral attention and spatial attention modules are merged
in parallel to construct the token mixing component for reducing computation
cost and a 3D convolution-based channel mixer module is integrated to enhance
stability and keep structure information. Comparison experiments conducted on
three representative HSI datasets captured by different sensors demonstrate the
proposed Tri-Former achieves better performance compared to several

experiments verified the effectiveness of the proposed SDT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12865v1

Of particular interest are structured pruning techniques, in which whole

shrunk architectures. Since its growth in popularity in the recent years,
pruning gave birth to countless papers and contributions, resulting first in
critical inconsistencies in the way results are compared, and then to a
collective effort to establish standardized benchmarks. However, said
benchmarks are based on training practices that date from several years ago and
do not align with current practices. In this work, we verify how results in the
recent literature of pruning hold up against networks that underwent both
state-of-the-art training methods and trivial model scaling. We find that the
latter clearly and utterly outperform all the literature we compared to,
proving that updating standard pruning benchmarks and re-evaluating classical

effect under the existence of unmeasured confounders. Within this framework,
the doubly robust (DR) estimator was derived and has shown its effectiveness in
estimation, especially when the model assumption is violated. However, the
current form of the DR estimator is restricted to binary treatments, while the
treatment can be continuous in many real-world applications. The primary
obstacle to continuous treatments resides in the delta function present in the
original DR estimator, making it infeasible in causal effect estimation and
introducing a heavy computational burden in nuisance function estimation. To
address these challenges, we propose a kernel-based DR estimator that can well
handle continuous treatments. Equipped with its smoothness, we show that its
oracle form is a consistent approximation of the influence function. Further,
we propose a new approach to efficiently solve the nuisance functions. We then
provide a comprehensive convergence analysis in terms of the mean square error.

challenges of recognizing unknown samples from novel classes in target query
sets and managing visual shifts between domains. However, existing techniques
fall short when it comes to identifying target outliers under domain shifts by
learning to reject pseudo-outliers from the source domain, resulting in an
incomplete solution to both problems. To address these challenges
comprehensively, we propose a novel approach called Domain Adaptive Few-Shot
Open Set Recognition (DA-FSOS) and introduce a meta-learning-based architecture
named DAFOSNET. During training, our model learns a shared and discriminative
embedding space while creating a pseudo open-space decision boundary, given a
fully-supervised source domain and a label-disjoint few-shot target domain. To
enhance data density, we use a pair of conditional adversarial networks with
tunable noise variances to augment both domains closed and pseudo-open spaces.
Furthermore, we propose a domain-specific batch-normalized class prototypes
alignment strategy to align both domains globally while ensuring
class-discriminativeness through novel metric objectives. Our training approach

the 3D digitization of faces is well explored, less attention has been drawn to
3D eyebrow modeling. In this work, we propose EMS, the first learning-based
framework for single-view 3D eyebrow reconstruction. Following the methods of
scalp hair reconstruction, we also represent the eyebrow as a set of fiber
curves and convert the reconstruction to fibers growing problem. Three modules
are then carefully designed: RootFinder firstly localizes the fiber root
positions which indicates where to grow; OriPredictor predicts an orientation
field in the 3D space to guide the growing of fibers; FiberEnder is designed to
determine when to stop the growth of each fiber. Our OriPredictor is directly
borrowing the method used in hair reconstruction. Considering the differences
between hair and eyebrows, both RootFinder and FiberEnder are newly proposed.
Specifically, to cope with the challenge that the root location is severely
occluded, we formulate root localization as a density map estimation task.
Given the predicted density map, a density-based clustering method is further
used for finding the roots. For each fiber, the growth starts from the root
point and moves step by step until the ending, where each step is defined as an
oriented line with a constant length according to the predicted orientation
field. To determine when to end, a pixel-aligned RNN architecture is designed
to form a binary classifier, which outputs stop or not for each growing step.
To support the training of all proposed networks, we build the first 3D
synthetic eyebrow dataset that contains 400 high-quality eyebrow models
manually created by artists. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the
effectiveness of the proposed EMS pipeline on a variety of different eyebrow
styles and lengths, ranging from short and sparse to long bushy eyebrows.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12787v1

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have significantly lower computational costs
(thousands of times) than regular non-spiking networks when implemented on
neuromorphic hardware. They have been used for video analysis with methods like
3D Convolutional Spiking Neural Networks (3D CSNNs). However, these networks
have a significantly larger number of parameters compared with spiking 2D CSNN.
This, not only increases the computational costs, but also makes these networks

performed new quantum mechanics computations of several reactions. We found
that 13 of the 15 reactions reported in the databases KIDA and UDfA have
incorrect products and/or rate constants. The new corrected reaction network
contains 10 reactions leading to methyl cyanide. We tested the relative

forming CH$_{3}$CNH$^{+}$, followed by the electron recombination of
CH$_{3}$CNH$^{+}$, is the most important CH$_3$CN formation route in both cold

incorporated to facilitate regularization by connecting the input coordinate

real-time inference speed with fewer parameters, they show poor detection
accuracy in complex defect scenarios. To this end, we develop a Global Context

defects on the encoder-decoder structure. First, we introduce a novel
transformer encoder on the top layer of the lightweight backbone, which
captures global context information through a novel Depth-wise Self-Attention

blockchain ecosystem, enabling users to swap tokens efficiently and
automatically. However, the capacity of miners to strategically order
transactions has led to exploitative practices (e.g., front-running attacks,
sandwich attacks) and gain substantial Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) for
their own advantage. To mitigate such manipulation, Ferreira and Parkes
recently proposed a greedy sequencing rule such that the execution price of
transactions in a block moves back and forth around the starting price.
Utilizing this sequencing rule makes it impossible for miners to conduct
sandwich attacks, consequently mitigating the MEV problem.
  However, no sequencing rule can prevent miners from obtaining risk-free
profits. This paper systemically studies the computation of a miner's optimal
strategy for maximizing MEV under the greedy sequencing rule, where the utility
of miners is measured by the overall value of their token holdings. Our results
unveil a dichotomy between the no trading fee scenario, which can be optimally
strategized in polynomial time, and the scenario with a constant fraction of
trading fee, where finding the optimal strategy is proven NP-hard. The latter
represents a significant challenge for miners seeking optimal MEV.
  Following the computation results, we further show a remarkable phenomenon:
Miner's optimal MEV also benefits users. Precisely, in the scenarios without
trading fees, when miners adopt the optimal strategy given by our algorithm,
all users' transactions will be executed, and each user will receive equivalent

  In our practice of operating microservices and serverless computing, we build

This trend has led to concerns over datacenters' increasing energy consumption

consumption to specific users and applications. Since datacenter servers tend
to be multi-tenant, i.e., they host many applications, server- and rack-level
power monitoring alone does not provide insight into their resident
applications' energy usage and carbon emissions. At the same time, current
application-level energy monitoring and attribution techniques are intrusive:
they require privileged access to servers and require coordinated support in
hardware and software, which is not always possible in cloud. To address the
problem, we design WattScope, a system for non-intrusively estimating the power
consumption of individual applications using external measurements of a
server's aggregate power usage without requiring direct access to the server's
operating system or applications. Our key insight is that, based on an analysis
of production traces, the power characteristics of datacenter workloads, e.g.,
low variability, low magnitude, and high periodicity, are highly amenable to
disaggregation of a server's total power consumption into application-specific
values. WattScope adapts and extends a machine learning-based technique for
disaggregating building power and applies it to server- and rack-level power

Finally, the quantum counting is introduced to get the amount (t) of the states

presented optimal consensus controller is obtained by solving Riccati equations

segmentation employs a few labeled images and an abundant of unlabeled images
to predict the pixel-level label map with the same size. Previous methods often
adopt co-training using two convolutional networks with the same architecture

features. This motivates us to use tri-training and develop the triple-view
encoder to utilize the encoders with different architectures to derive diverse
features, and exploit the knowledge distillation skill to learn the
complementary semantics among these encoders. Moreover, existing methods simply
concatenate the features from both encoder and decoder, resulting in redundant
features that require large memory cost. This inspires us to devise a
dual-frequency decoder that selects those important features by projecting the
features from the spatial domain to the frequency domain, where the
dual-frequency channel attention mechanism is introduced to model the feature
importance. Therefore, we propose a Triple-view Knowledge Distillation

was synthesized at an ultra-high vacuum system by reactive pulsed laser
deposition and characterized in situ by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The
material was also characterized ex situ by X-ray diffraction, transmission
electron microscopy, and the four-point probe method. It was detected that TaN
contained considerable oxygen impurities (up to 26 %O) even though it was grown
in an ultra-high vacuum chamber. Furthermore, the impurified TaN evidence a
face-centered cubic crystalline structure only and exhibits superconductivity

the effect of incorporating different amounts of O atoms in TaN using ab-initio

increases its stability as oxygen is added, demonstrating that oxygen may
always be present in TaN, even when obtained at ultra-high vacuum conditions.
All analyzed models exhibit metallic behavior. Charge density difference maps
reveal that N and O atoms have a higher charge density redistribution than Ta
atoms. The electron localization function maps and line profiles indicate that
Ta-O and Ta-N bonds are mainly ionic. As expected, stronger ionic behavior is
observed in the Ta-O bonds due to the electronegativity difference between O

have pervaded nearly every discipline in modern studies. Particularly, a number
of methods have been employed to estimate the redshift of gamma-ray loud active
galactic nuclei (AGN), which are a class of supermassive black hole systems
known for their intense multi-wavelength emissions and violent variability.
Determining the redshifts of AGNs is essential for understanding their
distances, which, in turn, sheds light on our current understanding of the
structure of the nearby universe. However, the task involves a number of
challenges such as the need for meticulous follow-up observations across
multiple wavelengths and astronomical facilities. In this study, we employ a
simple yet effective deep learning model with a single hidden layer having $64$
neurons and a dropout of 0.25 in the hidden layer, on a sample of AGNs with
known redshifts from the latest AGN catalog, 4LAC-DR3, obtained from Fermi-LAT.
We utilized their spectral, spatial, and temporal properties to robustly
predict the redshifts of AGNs as well quantify their associated uncertainties,
by modifying the model using two different variational inference methods. We
achieve a correlation coefficient of 0.784 on the test set from the frequentist
model and 0.777 and 0.778 from both the variants of variational inference, and,
when used to make predictions on the samples with unknown redshifts, we achieve

challenging task. In some applications, it may suffice to learn the causal
features of a given response variable, instead of learning the entire
underlying causal structure. Invariant causal prediction (ICP, Peters et al.,
2016) is a method for causal feature selection which requires data from
heterogeneous settings. ICP assumes that the mechanism for generating the
response from its direct causes is the same in all settings and exploits this
invariance to output a subset of the causal features. The framework of ICP has
been extended to general additive noise models and to nonparametric settings
using conditional independence testing. However, nonparametric conditional
independence testing often suffers from low power (or poor type I error
control) and the aforementioned parametric models are not suitable for
applications in which the response is not measured on a continuous scale, but
rather reflects categories or counts. To bridge this gap, we develop ICP in the
context of transformation models (TRAMs), allowing for continuous, categorical,
count-type, and uninformatively censored responses (we show that, in general,
these model classes do not allow for identifiability when there is no exogenous
heterogeneity). We propose TRAM-GCM, a test for invariance of a subset of
covariates, based on the expected conditional covariance between environments
and score residuals which satisfies uniform asymptotic level guarantees. For
the special case of linear shift TRAMs, we propose an additional invariance
test, TRAM-Wald, based on the Wald statistic. We implement both proposed
methods in the open-source R package ""tramicp"" and show in simulations that
under the correct model specification, our approach empirically yields higher

have been detected in the VHE range. We compare the number densities of the
circumburst medium of VHE-detected GRBs to check if the environment impacts the

larger population of GRBs. We employ machine learning algorithms to create
two-dimensional embeddings of GRB prompt emission light curves from the {\it

that VHE emission does not favour any particular cluster. These findings

between domain-invariant features (e.g., class identity) and domain-specific
features (e.g., environment) that does not generalize to the target domain.
Unfortunately, even enriched with additional unsupervised target domains,
existing Unsupervised DA (UDA) methods still suffer from it. This is because
the source domain supervision only considers the target domain samples as
auxiliary data (e.g., by pseudo-labeling), yet the inherent distribution in the
target domain -- where the valuable de-correlation clues hide -- is

statistically over a continuous parameter range. Running detailed stellar
evolution codes, such as MESA, over wide and densely sampled parameter grids is
prohibitively expensive computationally, while stellar-age based linear
interpolation in-between sparsely sampled grid points leads to intolerably
large systematic prediction errors. In this work, we provide two solutions of
automated interpolation methods that find satisfactory trade-off points between
cost-efficiency and accuracy. We construct a timescale-adapted evolutionary
coordinate and use it in a two-step interpolation scheme that traces the
evolution of stars from zero age main sequence all the way to the end of core
helium burning while covering a mass range from ${0.65}$ to $300 \,

quantum algorithms (VQAs), and are known to arise in various ways, from circuit
depth and hardware noise to global observables. However, a caveat of most
existing results is the requirement of t-design circuit assumptions that are
typically not satisfied in practice. In this work, we loosen these assumptions
altogether and derive tight upper and lower bounds on gradient concentration,
for a large class of parameterized quantum circuits and arbitrary observables.
By requiring only a couple of design choices that are constructive and easily
verified, our results can readily be leveraged to rule out barren plateaus for
explicit circuits and mixed observables, namely, observables containing a
non-vanishing local term. This insight has direct implications for hybrid
Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs), a generative model that can be
reformulated as a VQA with an observable composed of local and global terms. We
prove that designing the discriminator appropriately leads to 1-local weights
that stay constant in the number of qubits, regardless of discriminator depth.
Combined with our first contribution, this implies that qGANs with shallow
generators can be trained at scale without suffering from barren plateaus --
making them a promising candidate for applications in generative quantum
machine learning. We demonstrate this result by training a qGAN to learn a 2D
mixture of Gaussian distributions with up to 16 qubits, and provide numerical
evidence that global contributions to the gradient, while initially
exponentially small, may kick in substantially over the course of training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12681v1

alternative approach by providing training and evaluation environments for RS

the fact that many real-world learning problems are subject to constraints.
This paper bridges this gap by studying performative prediction under
inequality constraints. Unlike most existing work that provides only
performative stable points, we aim to find the optimal solutions. Anticipating
performative gradients is a challenging task, due to the agnostic performative
effect on data distributions. To address this issue, we first develop a robust
primal-dual framework that requires only approximate gradients up to a certain
accuracy, yet delivers the same order of performance as the stochastic
primal-dual algorithm without performativity. Based on this framework, we then
propose an adaptive primal-dual algorithm for location families. Our analysis
demonstrates that the proposed adaptive primal-dual algorithm attains
$\ca{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and constraint violations, using only $\sqrt{T} + 2T$

reached the $10^{-19}$ level at which the BBRz effect can be significant in
determining the uncertainty. In view of this, we probe first the BBRz shift in

determine the dynamic magnetic dipole (M1) polarizabilities of the clock states

static M1 polarizability limit in the estimation of the BBRz shift. The
resonance also leads to a reversal behavior of the temperature dependence and a

down-sampling and padding the robot sensor data in the time-series direction.
By learning multiple sensor data in a time series, the robot can generate

(multiplicative) savings of $O_{\varepsilon,\delta}(\sqrt{m})$ in terms of the
number of users required for achieving the same utility, where $m$ is the
number of examples per user. This algorithm, while recovering most known bounds

development, bearing substantial significance for both developers and
end-users. Moreover, it is a critical determinant in the consumer's
decision-making process when considering a smartphone purchase. From the
sustainability perspective, it becomes imperative to explore approaches aimed
at mitigating the energy consumption of mobile devices, given the significant
global consequences arising from the extensive utilisation of billions of
smartphones, which imparts a profound environmental impact. Despite the
existence of various energy-efficient programming practices within the Android
platform, the dominant mobile ecosystem, there remains a need for documented
machine learning-based energy prediction algorithms tailored explicitly for
mobile app development. Hence, the main objective of this research is to
propose a novel neural network-based framework, enhanced by a metaheuristic
approach, to achieve robust energy prediction in the context of mobile app
development. The metaheuristic approach here plays a crucial role in not only
identifying suitable learning algorithms and their corresponding parameters but
also determining the optimal number of layers and neurons within each layer. To
the best of our knowledge, prior studies have yet to employ any metaheuristic
algorithm to address all these hyperparameters simultaneously. Moreover, due to
limitations in accessing certain aspects of a mobile phone, there might be
missing data in the data set, and the proposed framework can handle this. In
addition, we conducted an optimal algorithm selection strategy, employing 13
metaheuristic algorithms, to identify the best algorithm based on accuracy and
resistance to missing values. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
our proposed approach yields significant outcomes for energy consumption
prediction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12484v1

COVID-19 pandemic, can oftentimes only be gained by analyzing sensitive data
spread across edge-devices like smartphones. To facilitate such an analysis, we
present a toolchain for a distributed, privacy-preserving aggregation of local
data by taking the limited resources of edge-devices into account. The
distributed aggregation is based on secure summation and simultaneously
satisfies the notion of differential privacy. In this way, other parties can
neither learn the sensitive data of single clients nor a single client's
influence on the final result. We perform an evaluation of the power
consumption, the running time and the bandwidth overhead on real as well as
simulated devices and demonstrate the flexibility of our toolchain by
presenting an extension of the summation of histograms to distributed
clustering.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12483v1

processes, but onlookers may learn reward functions by observing agents, which
can reveal sensitive information. Therefore, in this paper we introduce and
compare two methods for privatizing reward functions in policy synthesis for
multi-agent Markov decision processes. Reward functions are privatized using
differential privacy, a statistical framework for protecting sensitive data.
Both methods we develop rely on the Gaussian mechanism, which is a method of
randomization we use to perturb (i) each agent's individual reward function or
(ii) the joint reward function shared by all agents. We prove that both of
these methods are differentially private and compare the abilities of each to
provide accurate reward values for policy synthesis. We then develop an
algorithm for the numerical computation of the performance loss due to privacy
on a case-by-case basis. We also exactly compute the computational complexity
of this algorithm in terms of system parameters and show that it is inherently
tractable. Numerical simulations are performed on a gridworld example and in
waypoint guidance of an autonomous vehicle, and both examples show that privacy
induces only negligible performance losses in practice.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12476v1

can improve deep learning model performance for many vision-oriented tasks.
There are many possible ways to incorporate this additional information into a
deep learning model, but the optimal fusion strategy has not yet been
determined and can vary between applications. At one extreme, known as ""early
fusion,"" additional bands are stacked as extra channels to obtain an input
image with more than three channels. At the other extreme, known as ""late
fusion,"" RGB and non-RGB bands are passed through separate branches of a deep
learning model and merged immediately before a final classification or
segmentation layer. In this work, we characterize the performance of a suite of
multispectral deep learning models with different fusion approaches, quantify
their relative reliance on different input bands and evaluate their robustness
to naturalistic image corruptions affecting one or more input channels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12463v1
2309.12458v1,cs.LG,A Theory of Multimodal Learning,2023-09-21 20:05:49+00:00,"Human perception of the empirical world involves recognizing the diverse
appearances, or 'modalities', of underlying objects. Despite the longstanding
consideration of this perspective in philosophy and cognitive science, the
study of multimodality remains relatively under-explored within the field of
machine learning. Nevertheless, current studies of multimodal machine learning
are limited to empirical practices, lacking theoretical foundations beyond
heuristic arguments. An intriguing finding from the practice of multimodal
learning is that a model trained on multiple modalities can outperform a
finely-tuned unimodal model, even on unimodal tasks. This paper provides a
theoretical framework that explains this phenomenon, by studying generalization
properties of multimodal learning algorithms. We demonstrate that multimodal
learning allows for a superior generalization bound compared to unimodal
learning, up to a factor of $O(\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ represents the sample
size. Such advantage occurs when both connection and heterogeneity exist
between the modalities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12458v1

unobserved confounders. Sensitivity analysis methods are commonly used to
estimate the policy value under the worst-case confounding over a given
uncertainty set. However, existing work often resorts to some coarse relaxation
of the uncertainty set for the sake of tractability, leading to overly
conservative estimation of the policy value. In this paper, we propose a
general estimator that provides a sharp lower bound of the policy value using
convex programming. The generality of our estimator enables various extensions
such as sensitivity analysis with f-divergence, model selection with cross
validation and information criterion, and robust policy learning with the sharp
lower bound. Furthermore, our estimation method can be reformulated as an
empirical risk minimization problem thanks to the strong duality, which enables
us to provide strong theoretical guarantees of the proposed estimator using
techniques of the M-estimation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12450v1

essential to re-asses overall delay risk throughout the project life cycle.
Existing effort estimation models are static and not able to incorporate
changes occurring during project execution. In this paper, we propose a dynamic
model for continuously predicting overall delay using delay patterns and
Bayesian modeling. The model incorporates the context of the project phase and
learns from changes in team performance over time. We apply the approach to
real-world data from 4,040 epics and 270 teams at ING. An empirical evaluation
of our approach and comparison to the state-of-the-art demonstrate significant
improvements in predictive accuracy. The dynamic model consistently outperforms
static approaches and the state-of-the-art, even during early project phases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12449v1

systems with memory (time non-locality), have proven to be a robust and
scalable unconventional computing approach for solving a wide variety of
combinatorial optimization problems. However, most of the research so far has
focused on the numerical simulations of the equations of motion of DMMs. This
inevitably subjects time to discretization, which brings its own (numerical)
issues that would be absent in actual physical systems operating in continuous
time. Although hardware realizations of DMMs have been previously suggested,
their implementation would require materials and devices that are not so easy
to integrate with traditional electronics. In this study, we propose a novel
hardware design for DMMs that leverages only conventional electronic
components. Our findings suggest that this design offers a marked improvement
in speed compared to existing realizations of these machines, without requiring
special materials or novel device concepts. Moreover, the absence of numerical
noise promises enhanced stability over extended periods of the machines'
operation, paving the way for addressing even more complex problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12437v1

re-identification of people at long distances, such as from rooftop cameras,
UAV cameras, street cams, and others. Such recognition needs to go beyond face
and use whole-body markers such as gait. However, datasets to train and test
such recognition algorithms are not widely prevalent, and fewer are labeled.
This paper introduces DIOR -- a framework for data collection, semi-automated
annotation, and also provides a dataset with 14 subjects and 1.649 million RGB
frames with 3D/2D skeleton gait labels, including 200 thousands frames from a
long range camera. Our approach leverages advanced 3D computer vision
techniques to attain pixel-level accuracy in indoor settings with motion
capture systems. Additionally, for outdoor long-range settings, we remove the
dependency on motion capture systems and adopt a low-cost, hybrid 3D computer
vision and learning pipeline with only 4 low-cost RGB cameras, successfully
achieving precise skeleton labeling on far-away subjects, even when their
height is limited to a mere 20-25 pixels within an RGB frame. On publication,
we will make our pipeline open for others to use.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12429v1
2309.12424v1,cs.CV,DualToken-ViT: Position-aware Efficient Vision Transformer with Dual Token Fusion,2023-09-21 18:46:32+00:00,"Self-attention-based vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a highly
competitive architecture in computer vision. Unlike convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), ViTs are capable of global information sharing. With the
development of various structures of ViTs, ViTs are increasingly advantageous
for many vision tasks. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention
renders ViTs computationally intensive, and their lack of inductive biases of
locality and translation equivariance demands larger model sizes compared to
CNNs to effectively learn visual features. In this paper, we propose a
light-weight and efficient vision transformer model called DualToken-ViT that
leverages the advantages of CNNs and ViTs. DualToken-ViT effectively fuses the
token with local information obtained by convolution-based structure and the
token with global information obtained by self-attention-based structure to
achieve an efficient attention structure. In addition, we use position-aware
global tokens throughout all stages to enrich the global information, which
further strengthening the effect of DualToken-ViT. Position-aware global tokens
also contain the position information of the image, which makes our model
better for vision tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on image
classification, object detection and semantic segmentation tasks to demonstrate
the effectiveness of DualToken-ViT. On the ImageNet-1K dataset, our models of
different scales achieve accuracies of 75.4% and 79.4% with only 0.5G and 1.0G
FLOPs, respectively, and our model with 1.0G FLOPs outperforms LightViT-T using
global tokens by 0.7%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12424v1

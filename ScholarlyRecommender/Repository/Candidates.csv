interactions -- under real-world constraints is extremely challenging. It
requires exploiting the dynamics of the interaction, and planning through both
physical state and latent intent uncertainty. In this paper, we transform this
intractable problem into a supervised learning problem, where a
fully-observable robot policy generates supervision for a partially-observable
one. We find that the quality of the supervision signal for the
partially-observable pursuer policy depends on two key factors: the balance of
diversity and optimality of the evader's behavior and the strength of the
modeling assumptions in the fully-observable policy. We deploy our policy on a
physical quadruped robot with an RGB-D camera on pursuit-evasion interactions
in the wild. Despite all the challenges, the sensing constraints bring about
creativity: the robot is pushed to gather information when uncertain, predict
intent from noisy measurements, and anticipate in order to intercept. Project

from a pretrained Large Language Model by estimating a numeric confidence score
for any output it generated. Our uncertainty quantification technique works for
any LLM accessible only via a black-box API, and combines intrinsic and
extrinsic assessments of confidence into a single trustworthiness estimate for
any LLM response to a given prompt. Our method is extremely general and can
applied to all of the best LLMs available today (whose training data remains
unknown). By expending a bit of extra computation, users of any LLM API can now
get the same response as they would ordinarily, as well as a confidence
estimate that caution when not to trust this response. Experiments on both
closed and open-form Question-Answer benchmarks reveal that BSDetector more
accurately identifies incorrect LLM responses than alternative uncertainty
estimation procedures (for both GPT-3 and ChatGPT). By sampling multiple
responses from the LLM and considering the one with the highest confidence
score, we can additionally obtain more accurate responses from the same LLM,
without any extra training steps.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16175v1

themselves are invented, and are characterized from algebraic, topological, and

themselves initially, and interact with their environment subsequently.
Examples of the concept, such as those of granular balls, though inadequately
defined, algorithmically established, and insufficiently theorized in earlier
works by others, are already used in applications of rough sets and soft
computing. It is shown that they fit into multiple theoretical frameworks
(axiomatic, adaptive, and others) of granular computing. The characterization

2308.16137v1,cs.CL,LM-Infinite: Simple On-the-Fly Length Generalization for Large Language Models,2023-08-30 16:47:51+00:00,"In recent years, there have been remarkable advancements in the performance
of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. As
these LLMs are deployed for increasingly complex tasks, they often face the
needs to conduct longer reasoning processes or understanding larger contexts.
In these situations, the length generalization failure of LLMs on long
sequences become more prominent. Most pre-training schemes truncate training
sequences to a fixed length (such as 2048 for LLaMa). LLMs often struggle to
generate fluent texts, let alone carry out downstream tasks, after longer
contexts, even with relative positional encoding which is designed to cope with
this problem. Common solutions such as finetuning on longer corpora often
involves daunting hardware and time costs and requires careful training process
design. To more efficiently leverage the generation capacity of existing LLMs,
we theoretically and empirically investigate the main out-of-distribution (OOD)
factors contributing to this problem. Inspired by this diagnosis, we propose a
simple yet effective solution for on-the-fly length generalization,
LM-Infinite, which involves only a $\Lambda$-shaped attention mask and a
distance limit while requiring no parameter updates or learning. We find it
applicable to a variety of LLMs using relative-position encoding methods.
LM-Infinite is computational efficient with $O(n)$ time and space, and
demonstrates consistent fluency and generation quality to as long as 32k tokens
on ArXiv and OpenWebText2 datasets, with 2.72x decoding speedup. On downstream
task such as passkey retrieval, it continues to work on inputs much longer than
training lengths where vanilla models fail immediately.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16137v1

to when calculating product recommendations. Embedding similarity, which
utilizes pre-trained computer vision models to extract high-level image
features, has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in identifying images with
similar compositions. However, there is a lack of methods for evaluating the
embeddings generated by these models, as conventional loss and performance
metrics do not adequately capture their performance in image similarity search
tasks.
  In this paper, we evaluate the viability of the image embeddings from
numerous pre-trained computer vision models using a novel approach named
CorrEmbed. Our approach computes the correlation between distances in image
embeddings and distances in human-generated tag vectors. We extensively
evaluate numerous pre-trained Torchvision models using this metric, revealing
an intuitive relationship of linear scaling between ImageNet1k accuracy scores
and tag-correlation scores. Importantly, our method also identifies deviations
from this pattern, providing insights into how different models capture
high-level image features.
  By offering a robust performance evaluation of these pre-trained models,
CorrEmbed serves as a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners seeking

understanding and diagnosing survival models, which can lead to their
improvement. By revealing insights into the decision-making process, such as
variable effects and importances, survex enables the assessment of model
reliability and the detection of biases. Thus, transparency and responsibility

2308.16089v1,cs.LG,Application of Zone Method based Machine Learning and Physics-Informed Neural Networks in Reheating Furnaces,2023-08-30 15:26:35+00:00,"Despite the high economic relevance of Foundation Industries, certain
components like Reheating furnaces within their manufacturing chain are
energy-intensive. Notable energy consumption reduction could be obtained by
reducing the overall heating time in furnaces. Computer-integrated Machine
Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered control systems in
furnaces could be enablers in achieving the Net-Zero goals in Foundation
Industries for sustainable manufacturing.
  In this work, due to the infeasibility of achieving good quality data in
scenarios like reheating furnaces, classical Hottel's zone method based
computational model has been used to generate data for ML and Deep Learning
(DL) based model training via regression. It should be noted that the zone
method provides an elegant way to model the physical phenomenon of Radiative
Heat Transfer (RHT), the dominating heat transfer mechanism in high-temperature
processes inside heating furnaces. Using this data, an extensive comparison
among a wide range of state-of-the-art, representative ML and DL methods has
been made against their temperature prediction performances in varying furnace
environments. Owing to their holistic balance among inference times and model
performance, DL stands out among its counterparts. To further enhance the
Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalization capability of the trained DL models,
we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) by incorporating prior
physical knowledge using a set of novel Energy-Balance regularizers. Our setup
is a generic framework, is geometry-agnostic of the 3D structure of the
underlying furnace, and as such could accommodate any standard ML regression

in Neural Machine Translation (NMT). While prior research focused on using
multimodal data in low-resource scenarios, this study examines how image
features impact translation when added to a large-scale, pre-trained unimodal
NMT system. Surprisingly, the study finds that images might be redundant in
this context. Additionally, the research introduces synthetic noise to assess
whether images help the model deal with textual noise. Multimodal models
slightly outperform text-only models in noisy settings, even with random
images. The study's experiments translate from English to Hindi, Bengali, and
Malayalam, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks significantly.
Interestingly, the effect of visual context varies with source text noise: no
visual context works best for non-noisy translations, cropped image features
are optimal for low noise, and full image features work better in high-noise
scenarios. This sheds light on the role of visual context, especially in noisy
settings, opening up a new research direction for Noisy Neural Machine
Translation in multimodal setups. The research emphasizes the importance of
combining visual and textual information for improved translation in various

that use spatially-adaptive normalization layers, which allow for excellent
visual generation quality and editing versatility. Granted their efficacy,
recent research efforts have focused toward finer-grained local style control

overlook global image statistics leading to unconvincing local style editing
and causing global inconsistencies such as color or illumination distribution
shifts. Also, the semantic layout is required for mapping styles in the
generator, putting a strict alignment constraint over the features. In
response, we designed a novel architecture where cross-attention layers are
used in place of de-normalization ones for conditioning the image generation.
Our model inherits the advantages of both solutions, retaining state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality, as well as improved global and local style transfer.

either with or without a prior history of cardiovascular disease. Such events
are sparse (once in a lifetime), many victims will not have had prior
investigations for cardiac disease and many different definitions of sudden
death exist. Accordingly, sudden death is hard to predict.
  This analysis used NHS Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for people aged
$\geq$50 years living in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde (GG\&C) region in 2010
(n = 380,000) to try to overcome these challenges. We investigated whether
medical history, blood tests, prescription of medicines, and hospitalisations
might, in combination, predict a heightened risk of sudden death.
  We compared the performance of models trained to predict either sudden death
or all-cause mortality. We built six models for each outcome of interest: three
taken from state-of-the-art research (BEHRT, Deepr and Deep Patient), and three
of our own creation. We trained these using two different data representations:
a language-based representation, and a sparse temporal matrix.
  We used global interpretability to understand the most important features of
each model, and compare how much agreement there was amongst models using Rank
Biased Overlap. It is challenging to account for correlated variables without
increasing the complexity of the interpretability technique. We overcame this
by clustering features into groups and comparing the most important groups for
each model. We found the agreement between models to be much higher when
accounting for correlated variables.
  Our analysis emphasises the challenge of predicting sudden death and
emphasises the need for better understanding and interpretation of machine
learning models applied to healthcare applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16067v1

types in knowledge graphs (KG). Previously, KG embedding (KGE) methods tried to
solve the KGET task by introducing an auxiliary relation, 'hasType', to model
the relationship between entities and their types. However, a single auxiliary
relation has limited expressiveness for diverse entity-type patterns. We
improve the expressiveness of KGE methods by introducing multiple auxiliary
relations in this work. Similar entity types are grouped to reduce the number
of auxiliary relations and improve their capability to model entity-type
patterns with different granularities. With the presence of multiple auxiliary
relations, we propose a method adopting an Asynchronous learning scheme for
Entity Typing, named AsyncET, which updates the entity and type embeddings
alternatively to keep the learned entity embedding up-to-date and informative
for entity type prediction. Experiments are conducted on two commonly used KGET

noting that each car-following model possesses its own strengths and weaknesses
depending on specific driving scenarios. Therefore, we propose
EnsembleFollower, a hierarchical planning framework for achieving advanced
human-like car-following. The EnsembleFollower framework involves a high-level
Reinforcement Learning-based agent responsible for judiciously managing
multiple low-level car-following models according to the current state, either
by selecting an appropriate low-level model to perform an action or by
allocating different weights across all low-level components. Moreover, we
propose a jerk-constrained kinematic model for more convincing car-following
simulations. We evaluate the proposed method based on real-world driving data

EnsembleFollower yields improved accuracy of human-like behavior and achieves
effectiveness in combining hybrid models, demonstrating that our proposed

activations in such bit widths). In this study, we propose a novel W4A8
post-training quantization method for the available open-sourced LLMs, which
combines the advantages of both two recipes. Therefore, we can leverage the
benefit in the I/O utilization of 4-bit weight quantization and the
acceleration due to 8-bit matrix computation. Nevertheless, the W4A8 faces
notorious performance degradation. As a remedy, we involve layerwise activation
quantization strategies which feature a novel logarithmic equalization for most
intractable layers, and we combine them with fine-grained weight quantization.
Without whistles and bells, we eliminate the necessity for further fine-tuning
and obtain the state-of-the-art W4A8 quantized performance on BLOOM, LLaMA, and

Previous approaches model epidemics within single spatial scale, while ignoring
the multi-scale epidemic pat-terns derived from different scales. To address

critically involves the use of human or AI feedback. While dense feedback
annotations are expensive to acquire and integrate, sparse feedback presents a
structural design choice between ratings (e.g., score Response A on a scale of
1-7) and rankings (e.g., is Response A better than Response B?). In this work,
we analyze the effect of this design choice for the alignment and evaluation of
LLMs. We uncover an inconsistency problem wherein the preferences inferred from
ratings and rankings significantly disagree 60% for both human and AI
annotators. Our subsequent analysis identifies various facets of annotator
biases that explain this phenomena, such as human annotators would rate denser
responses higher while preferring accuracy during pairwise judgments. To our
surprise, we also observe that the choice of feedback protocol also has a
significant effect on the evaluation of aligned LLMs. In particular, we find
that LLMs that leverage rankings data for alignment (say model X) are preferred
over those that leverage ratings data (say model Y), with a rank-based
evaluation protocol (is X/Y's response better than reference response?) but not
with a rating-based evaluation protocol (score Rank X/Y's response on a scale
of 1-7). Our findings thus shed light on critical gaps in methods for

The heterogeneity in input data distributions across devices, commonly referred
to as the feature shift problem, can adversely impact the training convergence

classification knowledge, and diminish the mutual information term between the
client set and representations conditioned on labels to promote representations
of clients to be client-invariant. We further incorporate two regularizers into

global representation distribution to compensate for the absence of the
ground-truth global representation distribution, thus achieving informative and

speech is an important feature for accessible ASR systems. To improve the
accessibility of ASR systems for stutterers, we need to expose and analyze the
failures of ASR systems on stuttering speech. The speech datasets recorded from
stutterers are not diverse enough to expose most of the failures. Furthermore,
these datasets lack ground truth information about the non-stuttered text,
rendering them unsuitable as comprehensive test suites. Therefore, a
methodology for generating stuttering speech as test inputs to test and analyze
the performance of ASR systems is needed. However, generating valid test inputs
in this scenario is challenging. The reason is that although the generated test
inputs should mimic how stutterers speak, they should also be diverse enough to
trigger more failures. To address the challenge, we propose ASTER, a technique
for automatically testing the accessibility of ASR systems. ASTER can generate
valid test cases by injecting five different types of stuttering. The generated
test cases can both simulate realistic stuttering speech and expose failures in
ASR systems. Moreover, ASTER can further enhance the quality of the test cases
with a multi-objective optimization-based seed updating algorithm. We
implemented ASTER as a framework and evaluated it on four open-source ASR
models and three commercial ASR systems. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
of ASTER and find that it significantly increases the word error rate, match
error rate, and word information loss in the evaluated ASR systems.
Additionally, our user study demonstrates that the generated stuttering audio
is indistinguishable from real-world stuttering audio clips.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15742v1

tasks in various domains. Although we use GNNs in wide application scenarios,
it is a laborious task for researchers and practitioners to design/select
optimal GNN rchitectures in diverse graphs. To save human efforts and
computational costs, graph neural architecture search (Graph NAS) has been used
to search for a sub-optimal GNN architecture that combines existing components.
However, there are no existing Graph NAS methods that satisfy explainability,
efficiency, and adaptability to various graphs. Therefore, we propose an
efficient and explainable Graph NAS method, called ExGNAS, which consists of
(i) a simple search space that can adapt to various graphs and (ii) a search
algorithm that makes the decision process explainable. The search space
includes only fundamental functions that can handle homophilic and heterophilic
graphs. The search algorithm efficiently searches for the best GNN architecture
via Monte-Carlo tree search without neural models. The combination of our
search space and algorithm achieves finding accurate GNN models and the
important functions within the search space. We comprehensively evaluate our
method compared with twelve hand-crafted GNN architectures and three Graph NAS
methods in four graphs. Our experimental results show that ExGNAS increases AUC
up to 3.6 and reduces run time up to 78\% compared with the state-of-the-art

text generation to enhance factuality but often struggle with the knowledge
mix-up(e.g., entity mismatch) of irrelevant references. Besides,as the length

detrimentally impacting the factual accuracy of the generated text. In this
paper, we present DKGen, which divide the text generation process into an
iterative process. In each iteration, DKGen takes the input query, the
previously generated text and a subset of the reference passages as input to
generate short text. During the process, the subset is dynamically selected
from the full passage set based on their relevance to the previously generated

better use of AI-based decision support, including via training and onboarding.
Existing research has focused on decision-making tasks where it is possible to
evaluate ""appropriate reliance"" by comparing each decision against a ground
truth label that cleanly maps to both the AI's predictive target and the human
decision-maker's goals. However, this assumption does not hold in many
real-world settings where AI tools are deployed today (e.g., social work,
criminal justice, and healthcare). In this paper, we introduce a
process-oriented notion of appropriate reliance called critical use that
centers the human's ability to situate AI predictions against knowledge that is
uniquely available to them but unavailable to the AI model. To explore how
training can support critical use, we conduct a randomized online experiment in
a complex social decision-making setting: child maltreatment screening. We find
that, by providing participants with accelerated, low-stakes opportunities to
practice AI-assisted decision-making in this setting, novices came to exhibit
patterns of disagreement with AI that resemble those of experienced workers. A
qualitative examination of participants' explanations for their AI-assisted

in preserving battery health and in addressing the persistent problem of

particularly, Mobile Energy Disseminators (MEDs) have emerged as a promising
solution. The MED is mounted behind a large vehicle and charges all
participating EVs within a radius upstream of it. Unfortuantely, during such
V2V charging, the MED and EVs inadvertently form platoons, thereby occupying
multiple lanes and impairing overall corridor travel efficiency. In addition,
constrained budgets for MED deployment necessitate the development of an
effective dispatching strategy to determine optimal timing and locations for
introducing the MEDs into traffic. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) based methodology to develop a vehicle dispatching framework. In
the first component of the framework, we develop a realistic reinforcement
learning environment termed ""ChargingEnv"" which incorporates a reliable
charging simulation system that accounts for common practical issues in
wireless charging deployment, specifically, the charging panel misalignment.
The second component, the Proximal-Policy Optimization (PPO) agent, is trained
to control MED dispatching through continuous interactions with ChargingEnv.
Numerical experiments were carried out to demonstrate the demonstrate the

results suggest that the proposed model can significantly enhance EV travel
range while efficiently deploying a optimal number of MEDs. The proposed model

(LLMs) exhibit a unique phenomenon known as emergent abilities, demonstrating
adeptness across numerous tasks, from text summarization to code generation.
While these abilities open up novel avenues in software design and crafting,
their incorporation presents substantial challenges. Developers grapple with
decisions surrounding the direct embedding of LLMs within applications versus
employing them for code generation. Moreover, effective prompt design becomes a
critical concern, given the necessity of data extraction from natural language
outputs. To address these intricacies, this paper introduces AskIt, a
domain-specific language (DSL) specifically designed for LLMs. AskIt simplifies
LLM integration, offering type-guided output control, template-based function

Intelligence in the last decade. So far, deep learning researchers have been
particularly successful in the domain of image processing, where Convolutional
Neural Networks are used. Although excelling at image classification,
Convolutional Neural Networks are quite naive in that no inductive bias is set
on the embedding space for images. Similar flaws are also exhibited by another
type of Convolutional Networks - Graph Convolutional Neural Networks. However,
using non-Euclidean space for embedding data might result in more robust and
explainable models. One example of such a non-Euclidean space is hyperbolic
space. Hyperbolic spaces are particularly useful due to their ability to fit
more data in a low-dimensional space and tree-likeliness properties. These
attractive properties have been previously used in multiple papers which
indicated that they are beneficial for building hierarchical embeddings using
shallow models and, recently, using MLPs and RNNs.
  However, no papers have yet suggested a general approach to using Hyperbolic
Convolutional Neural Networks for structured data processing, although these
are the most common examples of data used. Therefore, the goal of this work is
to devise a general recipe for building Hyperbolic Convolutional Neural
Networks. We hypothesize that ability of hyperbolic space to capture hierarchy
in the data would lead to better performance. This ability should be
particularly useful in cases where data has a tree-like structure. Since this

performance in traffic forecasting. However, they often struggle to forecast
congestion accurately due to the limitations of traditional loss functions.
While accurate forecasting of regular traffic conditions is crucial, a reliable
AI system must also accurately forecast congestion scenarios to maintain safe
and efficient transportation. In this paper, we explore various loss functions
inspired by heavy tail analysis and imbalanced classification problems to
address this issue. We evaluate the efficacy of these loss functions in
forecasting traffic speed, with an emphasis on congestion scenarios. Through
extensive experiments on real-world traffic datasets, we discovered that when
optimizing for Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the MAE-Focal Loss function stands
out as the most effective. When optimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE), Gumbel
Loss proves to be the superior choice. These choices effectively forecast
traffic congestion events without compromising the accuracy of regular traffic
speed forecasts. This research enhances deep learning models' capabilities in
forecasting sudden speed changes due to congestion and underscores the need for
more research in this direction. By elevating the accuracy of congestion
forecasting, we advocate for AI systems that are reliable, secure, and

learning because of the poor generalization of minority classes. Traditionally,
the well-known synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) for data
augmentation, a data mining approach for imbalanced learning, has been used to
improve this generalization. However, it is unclear whether SMOTE also benefits
deep learning. In this work, we study why the original SMOTE is insufficient
for deep learning, and enhance SMOTE using soft labels. Connecting the
resulting soft SMOTE with Mixup, a modern data augmentation technique, leads to
a unified framework that puts traditional and modern data augmentation
techniques under the same umbrella. A careful study within this framework shows
that Mixup improves generalization by implicitly achieving uneven margins
between majority and minority classes. We then propose a novel margin-aware
Mixup technique that more explicitly achieves uneven margins. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed technique yields
state-of-the-art performance on deep imbalanced classification while achieving

(Dec-MARL) method to solve the SoC balancing problem in the distributed energy
storage system (DESS). First, the SoC balancing problem is formulated into a
finite Markov decision process with action constraints derived from demand
balance, which can be solved by Dec-MARL. Specifically, the first-order average
consensus algorithm is utilized to expand the observations of the DESS state in
a fully-decentralized way, and the initial actions (i.e., output power) are
decided by the agents (i.e., energy storage units) according to these
observations. In order to get the final actions in the allowable range, a
counterfactual demand balance algorithm is proposed to balance the total demand
and the initial actions. Next, the agents execute the final actions and get
local rewards from the environment, and the DESS steps into the next state.
Finally, through the first-order average consensus algorithm, the agents get
the average reward and the expended observation of the next state for later
training. By the above procedure, Dec-MARL reveals outstanding performance in a
fully-decentralized system without any expert experience or constructing any
complicated model. Besides, it is flexible and can be extended to other

traditional FAS methods based on single binary classification network may

2308.15244v1,cs.IR,Knowledge-based Multiple Adaptive Spaces Fusion for Recommendation,2023-08-29 12:11:16+00:00,"Since Knowledge Graphs (KGs) contain rich semantic information, recently
there has been an influx of KG-enhanced recommendation methods. Most of
existing methods are entirely designed based on euclidean space without
considering curvature. However, recent studies have revealed that a tremendous
graph-structured data exhibits highly non-euclidean properties. Motivated by
these observations, in this work, we propose a knowledge-based multiple
adaptive spaces fusion method for recommendation, namely MCKG. Unlike existing
methods that solely adopt a specific manifold, we introduce the unified space
that is compatible with hyperbolic, euclidean and spherical spaces.
Furthermore, we fuse the multiple unified spaces in an attention manner to
obtain the high-quality embeddings for better knowledge propagation. In
addition, we propose a geometry-aware optimization strategy which enables the
pull and push processes benefited from both hyperbolic and spherical spaces.
Specifically, in hyperbolic space, we set smaller margins in the area near to
the origin, which is conducive to distinguishing between highly similar
positive items and negative ones. At the same time, we set larger margins in
the area far from the origin to ensure the model has sufficient error
tolerance. The similar manner also applies to spherical spaces. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the MCKG has a
significant improvement over state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Further
ablation experiments verify the importance of multi-space fusion and
geometry-aware optimization strategy, justifying the rationality and
effectiveness of MCKG.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15244v1

Alongside this, we describe the entire pipeline, which comprises a feedback

a challenge due to the illegality of such activities. The recent chat leak of
the Conti RaaS operator, one of the most infamous ransomware operators on the
international scene, offers a key opportunity to better understand the inner
workings of such organizations. This paper analyzes the main topic discussions
in the Conti chat leak using machine learning techniques such as Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), as well as
visualization strategies. Five discussion topics are found: 1) Business, 2)
Technical, 3) Internal tasking/Management, 4) Malware, and 5) Customer
Service/Problem Solving. Moreover, the distribution of topics among Conti
members shows that only 4% of individuals have specialized discussions while
almost all individuals (96%) are all-rounders, meaning that their discussions
revolve around the five topics. The results also indicate that a significant
proportion of Conti discussions are non-tech related. This study thus
highlights that running such large RaaS operations requires a workforce skilled
beyond technical abilities, with individuals involved in various tasks, from
management to customer service or problem solving. The discussion topics also
show that the organization behind the Conti RaaS oper5086933ator shares

Extensive experiments on two PLMs demonstrate that MerA achieves substantial
improvements compared to both single adapters and AdapterFusion. To further

the image to be encoded into a suitable token representation for input to the

encode an image into a series of image-level feature map representations.
However, the generated reports often exhibit realistic style but imperfect
accuracy. Inspired by recent works for image captioning in the general domain
in which each visual token corresponds to an object detected in an image, we
investigate whether using local tokens corresponding to anatomical structures
can improve the quality of the generated reports. We introduce a novel
adaptation of Faster R-CNN in which finding detection is performed for the
candidate bounding boxes extracted during anatomical structure localisation. We
use the resulting bounding box feature representations as our set of
finding-aware anatomical tokens. This encourages the extracted anatomical
tokens to be informative about the findings they contain (required for the

one problem these systems face with modern English is the lack of gender
pronouns, where people try to alternate by using masculine, feminine, or plural

annotated conversations, was the best performing method. It correctly annotated
62.32% of the goal tracking MPCs, and 69.57% of the intent-slot recognition

translation (MMT) systems that enhance neural machine translation (NMT) with
visual knowledge. This problem setup involves using images as auxiliary
information during training, and more recently, eliminating their use during
inference. Towards this end, previous works face a challenge in training
powerful MMT models from scratch due to the scarcity of annotated multilingual
vision-language data, especially for low-resource languages. Simultaneously,
there has been an influx of multilingual pre-trained models for NMT and
multimodal pre-trained models for vision-language tasks, primarily in English,
which have shown exceptional generalisation ability. However, these are not
directly applicable to MMT since they do not provide aligned multimodal
multilingual features for generative tasks. To alleviate this issue, instead of
designing complex modules for MMT, we propose CLIPTrans, which simply adapts
the independently pre-trained multimodal M-CLIP and the multilingual mBART. In
order to align their embedding spaces, mBART is conditioned on the M-CLIP
features by a prefix sequence generated through a lightweight mapping network.
We train this in a two-stage pipeline which warms up the model with image
captioning before the actual translation task. Through experiments, we
demonstrate the merits of this framework and consequently push forward the
state-of-the-art across standard benchmarks by an average of +2.67 BLEU. The

triggering hypothesis, based on five large datasets in three language pairs,
reflecting both spoken and written bilingual interactions. Our results show
that words that are assumed to reside in a mental lexicon shared by both
languages indeed trigger code-switching; that the tendency to switch depends on
the distance of the trigger from the switch point; and on whether the trigger
precedes or succeeds the switch; but not on the etymology of the trigger words.

conspiracy-related activities throughout the year 2022. Our approach centers on
data collection that is independent of specific conspiracy theories and
information operations. Additionally, our dataset includes a control group
comprising randomly selected users who can be fairly compared to the
individuals involved in conspiracy activities. This comprehensive collection

of behavior and activity, particularly regarding the discussed topics, the
terminology used, and their stance on trending subjects. Interestingly, there
is no significant disparity in the presence of bot users between the two

improves the performance of PLMs for few-shot text classification with
task-specific templates. Yet, it is unclear how the prompting knowledge can be
transferred across tasks, for the purpose of mutual reinforcement. We propose
TransPrompt v2, a novel transferable prompting framework for few-shot learning
across similar or distant text classification tasks. For learning across
similar tasks, we employ a multi-task meta-knowledge acquisition (MMA)

embeddings among multiple distant tasks. Additionally, two de-biasing
techniques are further designed to make the trained meta-learner more
task-agnostic and unbiased towards any tasks. After that, the meta-learner can
be adapted to each specific task with better parameters initialization.
Extensive experiments show that TransPrompt v2 outperforms single-task and

bias, building on but differing from WinoBias, a commonly used gender bias
dataset, which is likely to be included in the training data of current LLMs.
We test four recently published LLMs and demonstrate that they express biased
assumptions about men and women's occupations. Our contributions in this paper
are as follows: (a) LLMs are 3-6 times more likely to choose an occupation that
stereotypically aligns with a person's gender; (b) these choices align with
people's perceptions better than with the ground truth as reflected in official
job statistics; (c) LLMs in fact amplify the bias beyond what is reflected in
perceptions or the ground truth; (d) LLMs ignore crucial ambiguities in
sentence structure 95% of the time in our study items, but when explicitly
prompted, they recognize the ambiguity; (e) LLMs provide explanations for their
choices that are factually inaccurate and likely obscure the true reason behind
their predictions. That is, they provide rationalizations of their biased
behavior. This highlights a key property of these models: LLMs are trained on
imbalanced datasets; as such, even with the recent successes of reinforcement
learning with human feedback, they tend to reflect those imbalances back at us.
As with other types of societal biases, we suggest that LLMs must be carefully

Traditional approaches in this area have favored frame-level dynamic
programming algorithms, such as dynamic time warping, because they require no

alternative, acoustic word embeddings -- fixed-dimensional vector
representations of variable-length spoken word segments -- have begun to be
considered for such tasks as well. However, the current space of such
discriminative embedding models, training approaches, and their application to
real-world downstream tasks is limited. We start by considering ``single-view""
training losses where the goal is to learn an acoustic word embedding model
that separates same-word and different-word spoken segment pairs. Then, we
consider ``multi-view"" contrastive losses. In this setting, acoustic word
embeddings are learned jointly with embeddings of character sequences to
generate acoustically grounded embeddings of written words, or acoustically
grounded word embeddings.
  In this thesis, we contribute new discriminative acoustic word embedding
(AWE) and acoustically grounded word embedding (AGWE) approaches based on
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We improve model training in terms of both
efficiency and performance. We take these developments beyond English to
several low-resource languages and show that multilingual training improves
performance when labeled data is limited. We apply our embedding models, both

agents and patients during emergency calls to a French call center, fills this
gap. The nature of these interactions highlights the role of the emotional flow
of the conversation in predicting patient emotions, as context can often make a
difference in understanding actual feelings. This paper presents a multi-scale
conversational context learning approach for speech emotion recognition, which
takes advantage of this hypothesis. We investigated this approach on both
speech transcriptions and acoustic segments. Experimentally, our method uses
the previous or next information of the targeted segment. In the text domain,
we tested the context window using a wide range of tokens (from 10 to 100) and
at the speech turns level, considering inputs from both the same and opposing
speakers. According to our tests, the context derived from previous tokens has
a more significant influence on accurate prediction than the following tokens.
Furthermore, taking the last speech turn of the same speaker in the

media platforms has become a critical area of research due to the growing
concerns about online safety, especially for vulnerable populations such as
children and adolescents. Researchers have been exploring various techniques
and approaches to develop effective detection systems that can identify and
mitigate these risks. Recent development of large language models (LLMs) has
opened a new opportunity to address this problem more effectively. This paper
proposes an approach to detection of online sexual predatory chats and abusive
language using the open-source pretrained Llama 2 7B-parameter model, recently
released by Meta GenAI. We fine-tune the LLM using datasets with different
sizes, imbalance degrees, and languages (i.e., English, Roman Urdu and Urdu).
Based on the power of LLMs, our approach is generic and automated without a
manual search for a synergy between feature extraction and classifier design
steps like conventional methods in this domain. Experimental results show a
strong performance of the proposed approach, which performs proficiently and
consistently across three distinct datasets with five sets of experiments. This
study's outcomes indicate that the proposed method can be implemented in
real-world applications (even with non-English languages) for flagging sexual
predators, offensive or toxic content, hate speech, and discriminatory language
in online discussions and comments to maintain respectful internet or digital
communities. Furthermore, it can be employed for solving text classification
problems with other potential applications such as sentiment analysis, spam and
phishing detection, sorting legal documents, fake news detection, language
identification, user intent recognition, text-based product categorization,
medical record analysis, and resume screening.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14683v1

Recognition (NER). It is used in many applications and also can be used as an
intermediate step for other tasks. We present ANER, a web-based named entity
recognizer for the Arabic, and Arabizi languages. The model is built upon BERT,
which is a transformer-based encoder. It can recognize 50 different entity
classes, covering various fields. We trained our model on the WikiFANE\_Gold
dataset which consists of Wikipedia articles. We achieved an F1 score of
88.7\%, which beats CAMeL Tools' F1 score of 83\% on the ANERcorp dataset,
which has only 4 classes. We also got an F1 score of 77.7\% on the
NewsFANE\_Gold dataset which contains out-of-domain data from News articles.
The system is deployed on a user-friendly web interface that accepts users'
inputs in Arabic, or Arabizi. It allows users to explore the entities in the
text by highlighting them. It can also direct users to get information about
entities through Wikipedia directly. We added the ability to do NER using our
model, or CAMeL Tools' model through our website. ANER is publicly accessible

tasks in spoken language understanding. Motivated by the fact that the two
tasks are closely related, joint models that can detect intents and extract
slots simultaneously are preferred to individual models that perform each task
independently. The accuracy of a joint model depends heavily on the ability of
the model to transfer information between the two tasks so that the result of
one task can correct the result of the other. In addition, since a joint model
has multiple outputs, how to train the model effectively is also challenging.
In this paper, we present a method for multiple intent detection and slot
filling by addressing these challenges. First, we propose a bidirectional joint
model that explicitly employs intent information to recognize slots and slot
features to detect intents. Second, we introduce a novel method for training
the proposed joint model using supervised contrastive learning and
self-distillation. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets MixATIS and
MixSNIPS show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both

outperform fine-tuned, non-generative models even with fewer examples. However,
subscription fees associated with these solutions may be considered costly for
small organizations. Lastly, we find that generative models perform better on
the given task when shown representative samples selected by a human expert

objectively enough to be provided with a definite, globally accepted answer.
  Controversial topics, such as ""religion"", ""gender identity"", ""freedom of
speech"", and ""equality"", among others, can be a source of conflict as partisan
or biased answers can reinforce preconceived notions or promote disinformation.
By exposing ChatGPT to such debatable questions, we aim to understand its level
of awareness and if existing models are subject to socio-political and/or
economic biases. We also aim to explore how AI-generated answers compare to
human ones. For exploring this, we use a dataset of a social media platform
created for the purpose of debating human-generated claims on polemic subjects
among users, dubbed Kialo.
  Our results show that while previous versions of ChatGPT have had important
issues with controversial topics, more recent versions of ChatGPT

several knowledge areas. In particular, it is well-moderated regarding economic
aspects. However, it still maintains degrees of implicit libertarian leaning
toward right-winged ideals which suggest the need for increased moderation from
the socio-political point of view. In terms of domain knowledge on
controversial topics, with the exception of the ""Philosophical"" category,

enormous parameter sizes of these models, leading to impractical runtime costs.
In light of these considerations, we introduce EdgeMoE, the first on-device
inference engine tailored for mixture-of-expert (MoE) LLMs, a popular variant

only when they are activated. This design is underpinned by a crucial insight
that expert weights, though voluminous, are infrequently accessed due to sparse
activation patterns. To further mitigate the overhead associated with expert
I/O swapping, EdgeMoE incorporates two innovative techniques: (1) Expert-wise

acceptable level of accuracy loss. (2) Expert management: It predicts the

knowledge across different but related tasks: this could be prevalent in very

to multitask learning, for model capabilities enhancement in Natural Language
Processing for the Fon language. Specifically, we explore the tasks of Named
Entity Recognition (NER) and Part of Speech Tagging (POS) for Fon. We leverage
two language model heads as encoders to build shared representations for the
inputs, and we use linear layers blocks for classification relative to each
task. Our results on the NER and POS tasks for Fon, show competitive (or
better) performances compared to several multilingual pretrained language
models finetuned on single tasks. Additionally, we perform a few ablation

community remains at an impasse, facing doubts concerning their purpose,

evaluation metrics. In this paper, we critically examine two sets of metrics:
the ERASER metrics (comprehensiveness and sufficiency) and the EVAL-X metrics,
focusing our inquiry on natural language processing. First, we show that we can
inflate a model's comprehensiveness and sufficiency scores dramatically without
altering its predictions or explanations on in-distribution test inputs. Our
strategy exploits the tendency for extracted explanations and their complements
to be ""out-of-support"" relative to each other and in-distribution inputs. Next,
we demonstrate that the EVAL-X metrics can be inflated arbitrarily by a simple
method that encodes the label, even though EVAL-X is precisely motivated to
address such exploits. Our results raise doubts about the ability of current

significant focus on two distinct categories: task-oriented (TOD) and

goals, such as finding a movie to watch, whereas open-domain systems primarily
focus on generating engaging conversations. A recent study by Chiu et al.

one-turn transition from chit-chat to task-oriented dialogues. However, the
previously generated data solely relied on BlenderBot, which raised concerns
about its long-turn naturalness and consistency during a conversation. To
address this issue, this paper aims to build SalesBot 2.0, a revised version of

the gap between chit-chat and TOD towards better naturalness and consistency.
The newly released large-scale dataset with detailed annotations exhibits

their mental models, yielding noteworthy theoretical and practical

relatively stable Big Five and/or MBTI personality traits. In addition,
cognitive process features form an essential component of these mental models.
Research in cultural psychology indicated significant differences in the
cognitive processes of Eastern and Western people when processing information
and making judgments. While Westerners predominantly exhibit analytical
thinking that isolates things from their environment to analyze their nature
independently, Easterners often showcase holistic thinking, emphasizing
relationships and adopting a global viewpoint. In our research, we probed the
cultural cognitive traits of ChatGPT. We employed two scales that directly
measure the cognitive process: the Analysis-Holism Scale (AHS) and the Triadic
Categorization Task (TCT). Additionally, we used two scales that investigate
the value differences shaped by cultural thinking: the Dialectical Self Scale
(DSS) and the Self-construal Scale (SCS). In cognitive process tests (AHS/TCT),
ChatGPT consistently tends towards Eastern holistic thinking, but regarding
value judgments (DSS/SCS), ChatGPT does not significantly lean towards the East
or the West. We suggest that the result could be attributed to both the
training paradigm and the training data in LLM development. We discuss the

from any patterns processed during training, commonly called abnormal or
out-of-distribution patterns, without providing any associated manual
segmentations. Since anomalies during deployment can lead to model failure,
detecting the anomaly can enhance the reliability of models, which is valuable
in high-risk domains like medical imaging. This paper introduces Masked
Modality Cycles with Conditional Diffusion (MMCCD), a method that enables
segmentation of anomalies across diverse patterns in multimodal MRI. The method
is based on two fundamental ideas. First, we propose the use of cyclic modality
translation as a mechanism for enabling abnormality detection.
Image-translation models learn tissue-specific modality mappings, which are
characteristic of tissue physiology. Thus, these learned mappings fail to
translate tissues or image patterns that have never been encountered during
training, and the error enables their segmentation. Furthermore, we combine
image translation with a masked conditional diffusion model, which attempts to
`imagine' what tissue exists under a masked area, further exposing unknown
patterns as the generative model fails to recreate them. We evaluate our method
on a proxy task by training on healthy-looking slices of BraTS2021

this direction, researchers have proposed models using conventional machine

by Dirksen, Maly and Rauhut [Annals of Statistics, 50(6), pp. 3538-3562]. The
estimator achieves near minimax rate for general sub-Gaussian distributions,
but also suffers from two downsides: theoretically, there is an essential gap
on operator norm error between their estimator and sample covariance when the
diagonal of the covariance matrix is dominated by only a few entries;
practically, its performance heavily relies on the dithering scale, which needs
to be tuned according to some unknown parameters. In this work, we propose a
new 2-bit covariance matrix estimator that simultaneously addresses both
issues. Unlike the sign quantizer associated with uniform dither in Dirksen et
al., we adopt a triangular dither prior to a 2-bit quantizer inspired by the
multi-bit uniform quantizer. By employing dithering scales varying across
entries, our estimator enjoys an improved operator norm error rate that depends
on the effective rank of the underlying covariance matrix rather than the
ambient dimension, thus closing the theoretical gap. Moreover, our proposed
method eliminates the need of any tuning parameter, as the dithering scales are
entirely determined by the data. Experimental results under Gaussian samples
are provided to showcase the impressive numerical performance of our estimator.
Remarkably, by halving the dithering scales, our estimator oftentimes achieves
operator norm errors less than twice of the errors of sample covariance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16059v1

multiple indices and preserve their structural relations. Based on this
representation, we propose a general framework of low-rank MTL methods with
tensorized support vector machines (SVMs) and least square support vector
machines (LSSVMs), where the CP factorization is deployed over the coefficient

combination of shared factors weighted by task-specific factors and is
generalized to both classification and regression problems. Through the
alternating optimization scheme and the Lagrangian function, each subproblem is
transformed into a convex problem, formulated as a quadratic programming or
linear system in the dual form. In contrast to previous MTL frameworks, our
decision function in the dual induces a weighted kernel function with a
task-coupling term characterized by the similarities of the task-specific
factors, better revealing the explicit relations across tasks in MTL.

Contrary to off-the-shelf stochastic VI, which slows down inference, plate
amortization results in orders of magnitude faster to train variational
distributions.
  Applied to large-scale hierarchical problems, PAVI yields expressive,
parsimoniously parameterized VI with an affordable training time. This faster

subgraphs in a temporal network that are allowed to vary over time to a certain
degree. In this paper, we search for dense subgraphs that have large pairwise
Jaccard similarity coefficients. More formally, given a set of graph snapshots
and a weight $\lambda$, we find a collection of dense subgraphs such that the
sum of densities of the induced subgraphs plus the sum of Jaccard indices,
weighted by $\lambda$, is maximized. We prove that this problem is NP-hard. To
discover dense subgraphs with good objective value, we present an iterative
algorithm which runs in $\mathcal{O}(n^2k^2 + m \log n + k^3 n)$ time per
single iteration, and a greedy algorithm which runs in $\mathcal{O}(n^2k^2 + m
\log n + k^3 n)$ time, where $k$ is the length of the graph sequence and $n$
and $m$ denote number of nodes and total number of edges respectively. We show
experimentally that our algorithms are efficient, they can find ground truth in
synthetic datasets and provide interpretable results from real-world datasets.
Finally, we present a case study that shows the usefulness of our problem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15936v1

width for the universal approximation property of deep, narrow MLPs. Among
these challenges, approximating a continuous function under the uniform norm is
important and challenging, with the gap between its lower and upper bound being
hard to narrow. In this regard, we propose a novel upper bound for the minimum
width, given by $\operatorname{max}(2d_x+1, d_y) + \alpha(\sigma)$, to achieve
uniform approximation in deep narrow MLPs, where $0\leq \alpha(\sigma)\leq 2$
represents the constant depending on the activation function. We demonstrate
this bound through two key proofs. First, we establish that deep, narrow MLPs
with little additional width can approximate diffeomorphisms. Secondly, we
utilize the Whitney embedding theorem to show that any continuous function can
be approximated by embeddings, further decomposed into linear transformations
and diffeomorphisms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15873v1

aims to learn models that generalize to unseen distributions. A common approach
is designing a data-driven surrogate penalty to capture generalization and
minimize the empirical risk jointly with the penalty. We argue that a
significant failure mode of this recipe is an excess risk due to an erroneous
penalty or hardness in joint optimization. We present an approach that
eliminates this problem. Instead of jointly minimizing empirical risk with the
penalty, we minimize the penalty under the constraint of optimality of the
empirical risk. This change guarantees that the domain generalization penalty
cannot impair optimization of the empirical risk, i.e., in-distribution
performance. To solve the proposed optimization problem, we demonstrate an
exciting connection to rate-distortion theory and utilize its tools to design
an efficient method. Our approach can be applied to any penalty-based domain
generalization method, and we demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to
three examplar methods from the literature, showing significant improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15856v1

regularization subtracted by initial estimators with the demonstrated capacity
to curtail non-asymptotic estimation errors. A pivotal question thus emerges:
Given the distinct ways the Adaptive Lasso and the Transfer Lasso employ
initial estimators, what benefits or drawbacks does this disparity confer upon
each method? This paper conducts a theoretical examination of the asymptotic
properties of the Transfer Lasso, thereby elucidating its differentiation from
the Adaptive Lasso. Informed by the findings of this analysis, we introduce a

imperative than ever. As a result, various privacy-preserving techniques have
been implemented to preserve user data privacy in DL. Among various
privacy-preserving techniques, collaborative learning techniques, such as Split
Learning (SL) have been utilized to accelerate the learning and prediction
process. Initially, SL was considered a promising approach to data privacy.
However, subsequent research has demonstrated that SL is susceptible to many
types of attacks and, therefore, it cannot serve as a privacy-preserving
technique. Meanwhile, countermeasures using a combination of SL and encryption
have also been introduced to achieve privacy-preserving deep learning. In this
work, we propose a hybrid approach using SL and Homomorphic Encryption (HE).
The idea behind it is that the client encrypts the activation map (the output
of the split layer between the client and the server) before sending it to the
server. Hence, during both forward and backward propagation, the server cannot
reconstruct the client's input data from the intermediate activation map. This
improvement is important as it reduces privacy leakage compared to other
SL-based works, where the server can gain valuable information about the
client's input. In addition, on the MIT-BIH dataset, our proposed hybrid
approach using SL and HE yields faster training time (about 6 times) and
significantly reduced communication overhead (almost 160 times) compared to
other HE-based approaches, thereby offering improved privacy protection for

FETSGAN, entire sequences are translated directly to the generator's sampling

specific spatial-temporal representation by modeling each MSS respectively.
Here both a simplified attention and a complicated attention are adopted to
balance the performance gain and resource consumption. (ii) Integrate Network

on MSS and captures the comprehensive spatial-temporal representation by
modeling the integrated sequence with a complicated attention. Both public

to backdoor attacks. An adversary carrying out a backdoor attack embeds a
predefined perturbation called a trigger into a small subset of input samples
and trains the DNN such that the presence of the trigger in the input results
in an adversary-desired output class. Such adversarial retraining however needs
to ensure that outputs for inputs without the trigger remain unaffected and
provide high classification accuracy on clean samples. In this paper, we
propose MDTD, a Multi-Domain Trojan Detector for DNNs, which detects inputs
containing a Trojan trigger at testing time. MDTD does not require knowledge of
trigger-embedding strategy of the attacker and can be applied to a pre-trained
DNN model with image, audio, or graph-based inputs. MDTD leverages an insight
that input samples containing a Trojan trigger are located relatively farther
away from a decision boundary than clean samples. MDTD estimates the distance
to a decision boundary using adversarial learning methods and uses this
distance to infer whether a test-time input sample is Trojaned or not. We
evaluate MDTD against state-of-the-art Trojan detection methods across five
widely used image-based datasets: CIFAR100, CIFAR10, GTSRB, SVHN, and
Flowers102; four graph-based datasets: AIDS, WinMal, Toxicant, and COLLAB; and

learn the data distribution. Finally, image clustering is achieved through each
Gaussian component of GMM. Yet, the ""curse of dimensionality"" poses severe
challenges for most clustering algorithms. Compared with the classic

precludes a closed-form candidate solution. We develop novel techniques,
including a leave-one-out-style argument which controls the correlation between
SDP solutions and noise vectors even when the removal of one row of noise can
drastically change the SDP solution. We also develop improved eigenvalue
perturbation bounds of potential independent interest. Using our gap-free

clustering with a faulty oracle with superior query complexities, notably
achieving $o(n^2)$ sample complexity even in the presence of a large number of

where, at each interaction step, the learner selects an arm and observes a
stochastic reward. Within the context of best-arm identification (BAI)
problems, the goal of the agent lies in finding the optimal arm, i.e., the one
with highest expected reward, as accurately and efficiently as possible.
Nevertheless, the sequential interaction protocol of classical BAI problems,
where the agent has complete control over the arm being pulled at each round,
does not effectively model several decision-making problems of interest (e.g.,
off-policy learning, partially controllable environments, and human feedback).
For this reason, in this work, we propose a novel strict generalization of the
classical BAI problem that we refer to as best-arm identification under
mediators' feedback (BAI-MF). More specifically, we consider the scenario in
which the learner has access to a set of mediators, each of which selects the
arms on the agent's behalf according to a stochastic and possibly unknown
policy. The mediator, then, communicates back to the agent the pulled arm
together with the observed reward. In this setting, the agent's goal lies in
sequentially choosing which mediator to query to identify with high probability
the optimal arm while minimizing the identification time, i.e., the sample
complexity. To this end, we first derive and analyze a statistical lower bound
on the sample complexity specific to our general mediator feedback scenario.
Then, we propose a sequential decision-making strategy for discovering the best
arm under the assumption that the mediators' policies are known to the learner.
As our theory verifies, this algorithm matches the lower bound both almost
surely and in expectation. Finally, we extend these results to cases where the
mediators' policies are unknown to the learner obtaining comparable results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15552v1

the underlying data distribution, corner cases and rare out-of-domain samples

becomes even more severe for dense tasks, such as 3D semantic segmentation,
where points of non-standard objects can be confidently associated to the wrong
class. In this work, we focus on improving the generalization to out-of-domain
data. We achieve this by augmenting the training set with adversarial examples.
First, we learn a set of vectors that deform the objects in an adversarial
fashion. To prevent the adversarial examples from being too far from the
existing data distribution, we preserve their plausibility through a series of
constraints, ensuring sensor-awareness and shapes smoothness. Then, we perform
adversarial augmentation by applying the learned sample-independent vectors to
the available objects when training a model. We conduct extensive experiments
across a variety of scenarios on data from KITTI, Waymo, and CrashD for 3D
object detection, and on data from SemanticKITTI, Waymo, and nuScenes for 3D
semantic segmentation. Despite training on a standard single dataset, our
approach substantially improves the robustness and generalization of both 3D

structured regularization that encourages approximately low rank solutions.
Specializing to neural network structure, we gain insights into how the
features and thus the kernel function change, providing additional nuance to
the phenomenon of kernel alignment when the target function is poorly
represented using tangent features. In addition to verifying our theoretical

  Depending on the specified combination of task and teacher(s), teacher(s) may
naturally act to limit the final performance of an agent. The extent to which
agents are required to adhere to teacher policies are determined by
hyperparameters which determine both the effect of teachers on learning speed
and the eventual performance of the agent on the task. In the humanoid domain

research. A promising avenue of exploration has been that of margin
measurements: the shortest distance to the decision boundary for a given sample

be correlated with the generalization ability of a model when measured at its
hidden representations (hidden margins), no such link between large margins and
generalization has been established for input margins. We show that while input
margins are not generally predictive of generalization, they can be if the
search space is appropriately constrained. We develop such a measure based on
input margins, which we refer to as `constrained margins'. The predictive power
of this new measure is demonstrated on the 'Predicting Generalization in Deep

physicians and computer-aided diagnosis systems. Mostly, current studies treat
segmentation and diagnosis as independent tasks without considering the

Therefore, it is worth combining them as a whole through exploring the
relationship between thyroid nodule segmentation and diagnosis. According to
the thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TI-RADS), the assessment of
shape and margin characteristics is the prerequisite for the discrimination of
benign and malignant thyroid nodules. These characteristics can be observed in
the thyroid nodule segmentation masks. Inspired by the diagnostic procedure of

the similarity in visual features between segmentation and diagnosis, SkaNet
shares visual features in the feature extraction stage and then utilizes a

acknowledging the variability of residual variances across covariates in the

achieve this, we propose a novel framework where the Gaussian process is
coupled with a covariate-induced precision matrix process, adopting a mixture
formulation. This approach enables the modeling of heteroscedastic covariance

systems requires a network that preserves the appropriate structure under each

Poisson bracket and the Hamiltonian. Hamiltonian systems with symmetries, whose
paradigm examples are the Lie-Poisson systems, have been shown to describe a
broad category of physical phenomena, from satellite motion to underwater
vehicles, fluids, geophysical applications, complex fluids, and plasma physics.
The Poisson bracket in these systems comes from the symmetries, while the
Hamiltonian comes from the underlying physics. We view the symmetry of the
system as primary, hence the Lie-Poisson bracket is known exactly, whereas the
Hamiltonian is regarded as coming from physics and is considered not known, or
known approximately. Using this approach, we develop a network based on
transformations that exactly preserve the Poisson bracket and the special

research in AEs has been active, and many adversarial attacks and explanations

existence is still an open question, and many studies suggest that DNN training
algorithms have blind spots. The salient objects usually do not overlap with
boundaries; hence, the boundaries are not the DNN model's attention.
Nevertheless, recent studies show that the boundaries can dominate the behavior
of the DNN models. Hence, this study aims to look at the AEs from a different
perspective and proposes an imperceptible adversarial attack that systemically
attacks the input image boundary for finding the AEs. The experimental results

expressive architectures by exploiting structured state space models (SSMs).
These models have shown promise in capturing long-term dependencies in time

better performance, but also gain insights into long-standing questions in the
field. Specifically, for standard diagnostic tasks, we find no advantage in
using higher sampling rates such as 500Hz compared to 100Hz. Similarly,
extending the input size of the model beyond 3 seconds does not lead to
significant improvements. Secondly, we demonstrate that self-supervised
learning using contrastive predictive coding can further improve the
performance of SSMs. By leveraging self-supervision, we enable the model to
learn more robust and representative features, leading to improved analysis
accuracy. Lastly, we depart from synthetic benchmarking scenarios and
incorporate basic demographic metadata alongside the ECG signal as input. This

precisely bounding the L2 sensitivity can be hard, thus leading to loose
privacy bounds. In this work, we consider a Relative L2 sensitivity assumption,

patterns. The aim of this article is to reveal periodically changing malware
behaviors through cyclostationarity. The study highlights the importance of
spotting cyclostationary malware in NIDSs by using established datasets like
KDD99, NSL-KDD, and the UGRansome dataset. The UGRansome dataset is designed
for anomaly detection research and includes both normal and abnormal network
threat categories of zero-day attacks. A comparison is made using the Random
Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms, while also evaluating
the effectiveness of Boruta and PCA. The findings show that PCA is more
promising than using Boruta alone for extracting cyclostationary network
feature patterns. Additionally, the analysis identifies the internet protocol
as the most noticeable cyclostationary feature pattern used by malware.
Notably, the UGRansome dataset outperforms the KDD99 and NSL-KDD, achieving 99%

analysis of GE with selected pivoting strategies on well-conditioned systems

growth is possible with GE with partial pivoting (GEPP), growth tends to stay
much smaller in practice. Support for this behavior was provided last year by
Huang and Tikhomirov's average-case analysis of GEPP, which showed GEPP growth
factors stay at most polynomial with very high probability when using small
Gaussian perturbations. GE with complete pivoting (GECP) has also seen a lot of
recent interest, with recent improvements to lower bounds on worst-case GECP
growth provided by Edelman and Urschel earlier this year. We are interested in
studying how GEPP and GECP behave on the same linear systems as well as
studying large growth on particular subclasses of matrices, including
orthogonal matrices. We will also study systems when GECP leads to larger
growth than GEPP, which will lead to new empirical lower bounds on how much
worse GECP can behave compared to GEPP in terms of growth. We also present an

given in terms of an unbounded linear operator $A$ and the Caputo fractional
derivative of order $\alpha \in (0, 2)$ in time. The previously known
representation of the mild solution to such a problem does not have a
conventional variation-of-constants like form, with the propagator derived from
the associated homogeneous problem. Instead, it relies on the existence of two
propagators with different analytical properties. This fact limits theoretical
and especially numerical applicability of the existing solution representation.
Here, we propose an alternative representation of the mild solution to the
given problem that consolidates the solution formulas for sub-parabolic,
parabolic and sub-hyperbolic equations with a positive sectorial operator $A$
and non-zero initial data. The new representation is solely based on the
propagator of the homogeneous problem and, therefore, can be considered as a
more natural fractional extension of the solution to the classical parabolic
Cauchy problem. By exploiting a trade-off between the regularity assumptions on
the initial data in terms of the fractional powers of $A$ and the regularity
assumptions on the right-hand side in time, we show that the proposed solution
formula is strongly convergent for $t \geq 0$ under considerably weaker
assumptions compared to the standard results from the literature. Crucially,
the achieved relaxation of space regularity assumptions ensures that the new

Consequently, inside the fracture, a Stokes flow can be modelled that is

formulated by (i) a hierarchy of low-order quasidiffusion (aka variable
Eddington factor) equations for moments of the radiation intensity and (ii) the
normalized Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). The multilevel system of moment
equations is derived by projection of the BTE onto a sequence of subspaces
which represent elements of the phase space of the problem. Exact closure for
the moment equations is provided by the Eddington tensor. A Petrov-Galerkin
(PG) projection of the normalized BTE is formulated using a proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD) basis representing the normalized radiation intensity over
the whole phase space and time. The Eddington tensor linearly depends on the
solution of the normalized BTE. By linear superposition of the POD basis
functions, a low-rank expansion of the Eddington tensor is constructed with
coefficients defined by the PG projected normalized BTE. The material energy

optimization, with adaptive regularization, as they possess better/optimal
worst-case evaluation complexity globally and faster convergence
asymptotically. These algorithms crucially rely on repeatedly minimizing
nonconvex multivariate Taylor-based polynomial sub-problems, at least locally.
Finding efficient techniques for the solution of these sub-problems, beyond the
second-order case, has been an open question. This paper proposes a
second-order method, Quadratic Quartic Regularisation (QQR), for efficiently
minimizing nonconvex quartically-regularized cubic polynomials, such as the
AR$p$ sub-problem [3] with $p=3$. Inspired by [35], QQR approximates the
third-order tensor term by a linear combination of quadratic and quartic terms,
yielding (possibly nonconvex) local models that are solvable to global
optimality. In order to achieve accuracy $\epsilon$ in the first-order
criticality of the sub-problem, we show that the error in the QQR method
decreases either linearly or by at least $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{4/3})$ for
locally convex iterations, while in the sufficiently nonconvex case, by at
least $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$; thus improving, on these types of iterations,
the general cubic-regularization bound. Preliminary numerical experiments

handling discretized differential operators that often worsen the

presenting the first extension of the quasi-Helmholtz projectors to high-order

Computational experiments demonstrate close agreement between the error
estimate and actual absolute error in the approximation. Such methods are
necessary or desirable when approximating solutions to PDE (or in the case of

  Results: In the merging type, a characteristic spiral flow is observed in AVF

type shows a smooth flow and gives a smaller pressure drop. The one-way case is
intermediate between splitting and merging types.

application of the fast Fourier transform. However, the computational
complexity inevitably becomes high which significantly impedes e.g. the
generation of the phase diagram since a high-fidelity simulation of a problem

spatially correlated. We introduce an efficient technique for representing and
processing spatially correlated random fields in robust topology optimisation

structural response to obtain a design whose performance is less sensitive to
the specific realisation of the random field. We represent Gaussian random
fields on lattices by leveraging the established link between random fields and
stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). It is known that the
precision matrix, i.e. the inverse of the covariance matrix, of a random field
with Mat\'ern covariance is equal to the finite element stiffness matrix of a
possibly fractional PDE with a second-order elliptic operator. We consider the
discretisation of the PDE on the lattice to obtain a random field which, by
design, considers its geometry and connectivity. The so-obtained random field
can be interpreted as a physics-informed prior by the hypothesis that the
elliptic SPDE models the physical processes occurring during manufacturing,
like heat and mass diffusion. Although the proposed approach is general, we
demonstrate its application to lattices modelled as pin-jointed trusses with
uncertainties in member Young's moduli. We consider as a cost function the
weighted sum of the expectation and standard deviation of the structural
compliance. To compute the expectation and standard deviation and their
gradients with respect to member cross-sections we use a first-order Taylor

according to the interface, and leverages multiple branch networks and truck
networks. Each branch network extracts latent representations of input
functions at a fixed number of sensors on a specific sub-domain, and each truck
network is responsible for output solutions on one sub-domain. In addition,
tailored physics-informed loss of IONet is proposed to ensure physical
consistency, which greatly reduces the requirement for training datasets and
makes IONet effective without any paired input-output observations in the

oversampling, with collocation points inside the domain only, resulting in a
rectangular linear system to be solved in a least squares sense. The goal of
this paper is the efficient solution of that rectangular system. We show that
the least squares problem splits into a regular part, which can be expedited

shock waves. Shock waves feature jump discontinuities in the velocity and
density of the fluid and thus preclude the existence of classical solutions to
the compressible Euler equations. Weak ""entropy"" solutions are commonly defined
by viscous regularization, but even small amounts of viscosity can
substantially change the long-term behavior of the solution. In this work, we
propose an inviscid regularization based on ideas from semidefinite programming
and information geometry. From a Lagrangian perspective, shock formation in
entropy solutions amounts to inelastic collisions of fluid particles. Their
trajectories are akin to that of projected gradient descent on a feasible set
of nonintersecting paths. We regularize these trajectories by replacing them
with solution paths of interior point methods based on log determinantal
barrier functions. These paths are geodesic curves with respect to the
information geometry induced by the barrier function. Thus, our regularization
amounts to replacing the Euclidean geometry of phase space with a suitable
information geometry. We extend this idea to infinite families of paths by
viewing Euler's equations as a dynamical system on a diffeomorphism manifold.
Our regularization embeds this manifold into an information geometric ambient

addition, the compressive sensing recovery algorithm itself (which takes the

Helmholtz equation has been an open problem in applied mathematics for years.
Much effort has been dedicated to finding solution methods which can use
multigrid components to obtain solvers with a linear time complexity. In this
work we present one among the first stand-alone multigrid solvers for the 2D
Helmholtz equation using both a constant and non-constant wavenumber model
problem. We use standard smoothing techniques and do not impose any
restrictions on the number of grid points per wavelength on the coarse-grid. As
a result we are able to obtain a full V- and W-cycle algorithm. The key
features of the algorithm are the use of higher-order inter-grid transfer
operators combined with a complex constant in the coarsening process. Using
weighted-Jacobi smoothing, we obtain a solver which is $h-$independent and
scales linearly with the wavenumber $k$. Numerical results using 1 to 5
GMRES(3) smoothing steps approach $k-$ and $h-$ independent convergence, when
combined with the higher-order inter-grid transfer operators and a small or

to its versatile and natural ability to handle ill-posedness. However, it often
faces challenges when dealing with situations involving continuous fields or
large-resolution discrete representations (high-dimensional). Moreover, the
prior distribution of unknown parameters is commonly difficult to be
determined. In this study, an Operator Learning-based Generative Adversarial
Network (OL-GAN) is proposed and integrated into the Bayesian inference
framework to handle these issues. Unlike most Bayesian approaches, the
distinctive characteristic of the proposed method is to learn the joint
distribution of parameters and responses. By leveraging the trained generative
model, the posteriors of the unknown parameters can theoretically be
approximated by any sampling algorithm (e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo, MCMC)
in a low-dimensional latent space shared by the components of the joint
distribution. The latent space is typically a simple and easy-to-sample
distribution (e.g., Gaussian, uniform), which significantly reduces the
computational cost associated with the Bayesian inference while avoiding prior
selection concerns. Furthermore, incorporating operator learning enables
resolution-independent in the generator. Predictions can be obtained at desired
coordinates, and inversions can be performed even if the observation data are
misaligned with the training data. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed
method is validated through several numerical experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13295v1

updates of positive definite matrices which are close to singular. These
systems arise in the contexts of nonsmooth Newton methods using generalized
Jacobians. We derive an explicit formula for the optimal
$\omega$-preconditioned update in this framework.
  Evaluating or estimating the classical condition number $\kappa$ can be
expensive. We show that the $\omega$-condition number can be evaluated exactly

Pore-scale modeling of reactive flow offers a valuable opportunity to
investigate the evolution of macro-scale properties subject to dynamic
processes. Yet, they suffer from imaging limitations arising from the
associated X-ray microtomography (X-ray microCT) process, which induces
discrepancies in the properties estimates. Assessment of the kinetic parameters
also raises challenges, as reactive coefficients are critical parameters that
can cover a wide range of values. We account for these two issues and ensure
reliable calibration of pore-scale modeling, based on dynamical microCT images,

  The present method is based on a multitasking formulation of reactive inverse

porosity field and estimating reactive parameter ranges through prescribed PDE
models with a latent concentration field and dynamical microCT. The data
assimilation strategy relies on sequential reinforcement incorporating
successively additional PDE constraints. We guarantee robust and unbiased
uncertainty quantification by straightforward adaptive weighting of Bayesian

studies on beam-like topologically interlocked structures have shown that, with
non-planar blocks, it is possible to reach levels of strength and
work-to-failure which are otherwise possible only with unrealistically high
friction coefficients. While non-planar blocks have been extensively used for
slab-like assemblies, many questions in that context are still not fully

non-planar surface morphologies which can potentially improve the enhanced
mechanical response of slab-like assemblies. In addition, it is unclear if
slab-like structures with non-planar surface blocks can reach a saturated
response with realistic friction coefficient values, as is the case with

such as the WSA model in space weather forecasting to improve the physical
accuracy of the predictions. This model has, however, several simplifications
implemented in its formulation to allow for rapid convergence, one of which
includes a single-fluid treatment. In this paper, we have two goals. Firstly,
we aim to introduce a novel multi-fluid global coronal model and validate it
with simple cases as well as with real data-driven applications. Secondly, we
aim to investigate to what extent considering a single-fluid plasma in the
global coronal model might affect the resulting plasma dynamics, and thus
whether the assumptions on which the single-fluid coronal model is based are
justified. We developed a multi-fluid global coronal model, COCONUT-MF, which
resolves the ion and neutral fluid equations separately. While this model is
still steady-state and thus does not resolve unsteady processes, it can account
for charge exchange, chemical and collisional contributions. We present the
results of the ion-neutral modelling for a dipole, a minimum of solar activity,
and a solar maximum. We demonstrate the higher accuracy of the applied AUSM+
scheme compared to HLL. Subsequently, we also evaluate the effects of the
considered ion-neutral coupling terms on the resulting plasma dynamics. Despite
the very low concentration of neutrals, these terms still affect the flow field
to a limited but non-negligible extent (up to 5 to 10% locally). Even though
the coronal plasma is generally assumed to be collisionless, our results show
that there is sufficient collisionality in it to couple the two fluids.
Follow-up work will include extension of the model to lower atmospheric layers

radiation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16043v1

ultracold plasmas were considered as a promising tool to achieve considerable
values of the Coulomb coupling parameter for electrons. Unfortunately, this was
found to be precluded by a sharp spontaneous increase of temperature, which was
commonly attributed to the so-called disorder-induced heating (DIH). It is the
aim of the present paper to quantify this effect as function of the initial
ionic disorder and, thereby, to estimate the efficiency of its mitigation,
e.g., by the Rydberg blockade. As a result of the performed simulations, we
found that the dynamics of electrons exhibited a well-expressed transition from
the case of the quasi-regular arrangement of ions to the disordered one; the
magnitude of the effect being about 30%. Thereby, we can conclude that the
two-step formation of ultracold plasmas - involving the intermediate stage of

Floquet system (in this case the Floquet system is the Anomalous
Floquet-Anderson Insulator). This information is used to correct the system for
noise after which these qubits are removed. The fact that these external qubits
are added and then removed after performing operations on the system is what
allows for this process to be referred to as non-Hermitian driving. The
external qubits effectively act to carry away entropy of the system and
therefore allow for the Floquet system to be cooled. In addition, another

seniority-based CI (sCI) by evaluating how different ground-state properties of
radicals converge to the full CI limit. We find that hCI outperforms or matches
eCI, whereas sCI is far less accurate, in line with previous observations for
closed-shell molecules. Employing the second-order Epstein-Nesbet perturbation
theory as a correction significantly accelerates the convergence of hCI and
eCI. We further explore various hCI and sCI models to calculate excitation
energies of closed- and open-shell systems. Our results underline that both the
choice of the reference determinant and the set of orbitals drive the fine
balance between correlation of ground and excited states. State-specific hCI2
and higher order models perform similarly to their eCI counterparts, whereas
lower orders of hCI deliver poor results. In turn, sCI1 produces decent

Decomposition (DMD) algorithm based on variable projection optimization, called
Optimized DMD (OPT-DMD), enables a robust identification of the dominant
spatiotemporally coherent modes underlying the data across various test cases

As the OPT-DMD can be constrained to produce stable reduced-order models (ROMs)
by construction, in this paper, we extend the application of the OPT-DMD and
investigate the capabilities of the linear ROM from this algorithm toward
forecasting in time of the plasma dynamics in configurations representative of
the radial-azimuthal and axial-azimuthal cross-sections of a Hall thruster and
over a range of simulation parameters in each test case. The predictive
capacity of the OPT-DMD ROM is assessed primarily in terms of short-term
dynamics forecast or, in other words, for large ratios of training-to-test
data. However, the utility of the ROM for long-term dynamics forecasting is
also presented for an example case in the radial-azimuthal configuration. The
model's predictive performance is heterogeneous across various test cases.
Nonetheless, a remarkable predictiveness is observed in the test cases that do
not exhibit highly transient behaviors. Moreover, in all investigated cases,
the error between the ground-truth and the reconstructed data from the OPT-DMD
ROM remains bounded over time within both the training and the test window. As

leads to an exponential decay of the survival probability $P(t) \sim e^{-\kappa
t}$ with an escape rate $\kappa$ that decreases with $E$. Dissipation
$\gamma>0$ leads to the appearance of different finite-time regimes in $P(t)$.
We show how these different regimes can be understood for small $\gamma\ll 1$
and $t\gg 1/\kappa_0$ from the effective escape rate
$\kappa_\gamma(t)=\kappa_0(E(t))$ (including the non-hyperbolic regime) until
the energy reaches a critical value $E_c$ at which no escape is possible. More
generally, we argue that for small dissipation $\gamma$ and long times $t$ the
surviving trajectories in the dissipative system are distributed according to
the conditionally invariant measure of the conservative system at the
corresponding energy $E(t)<E(0)$. Quantitative predictions of our general
theory are compared with numerical simulations in the Henon-Heiles model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13555v1

Our analysis focuses on a thorough, side-by-side comparison of dynamic

of Mo and V atoms in W matrices introduces lattice strain and distortion,
increasing material resistance to deformation and slowing down dislocation
mobility of dislocation loops with a Burgers vector of 1/2 $\langle 111

plastic zone size in equiatomic W--V RSS, but not in equiatomic W--Mo RSS

of volume in 3D Ising data. We find that as opposed to 2D systems for which
this quantity has been successfully used in unsupervised characterizations of
critical phenomena, in the 3D case its estimation is far more challenging. To
circumvent this limitation, we then use the principal component analysis (PCA)
entropy, a ""Shannon entropy"" of the normalized spectrum of the covariance

which the PCA entropy approaches asymptotically. The latter allows us to
extract -- through a conventional finite-size scaling analysis with modest
lattice sizes -- the critical temperature with less than $1\%$ error for both

This unmixing process requires that mixing preserves the identity of the

spectrally distinct. Even with these requirements met, extracting the
endmembers from a single mixture may be impossible; an ensemble of mixtures
with sufficient diversity is needed. Several spectral unmixing approaches have
been proposed, many of which are connected to hyperspectral imaging. However,
most of them assume highly diverse collections of mixtures and extremely
low-loss spectroscopic measurements. Additionally, these frameworks do not
incorporate the uncertainty inherent in unmixing. We propose a probabilistic
inference approach that explicitly incorporates noise and uncertainty, enabling
us to unmix endmembers in collections of mixtures with limited diversity. We
use a Bayesian mixture model to jointly extract endmember spectra and mixing
parameters while explicitly modeling observation noise and the resulting
inference uncertainties. We obtain approximate distributions over endmember

established and emerging applications ranging from quantum computing and
communication to metrology and sensing. Regardless of their nature, quantum
emitters universally display fluorescence intermittency or photoblinking:
interaction with the environment can cause the emitters to undergo quantum
jumps between on and off states that correlate with higher and lower
photoemission events, respectively. Understanding and quantifying the mechanism
and dynamics of photoblinking is important for both fundamental and practical
reasons. However, the analysis of blinking time traces is often afflicted by
data scarcity. Blinking emitters can photo-bleach and cease to fluoresce over
time scales that are too short for their photodynamics to be captured by
traditional statistical methods. Here, we demonstrate two approaches based on
machine learning that directly address this problem. We present a multi-feature
regression algorithm and a genetic algorithm that allow for the extraction of
blinking on/off switching rates with >85% accuracy, and with >10x less data and
>20x higher precision than traditional methods based on statistical inference.
Our algorithms effectively extend the range of surveyable blinking systems and
trapping dynamics to those that would otherwise be considered too short-lived
to be investigated. They are therefore a powerful tool to help gain a better

animals' movement and habitat preferences. Their popularity has grown rapidly
and extensions have been developed to increase their utility, including various
distributions to describe movement constraints, interactions to allow movements
to depend on local environmental features, and random effects and latent states
to account for within- and among-individual variability. Although the SSF is a
relatively simple statistical model, its presentation has not been consistent
in the literature, leading to confusion about model flexibility and
interpretation. We believe that part of the confusion has arisen from the
conflation of the SSF model with the methods used for parameter estimation.
Notably, conditional logistic regression can be used to fit SSFs in exponential
form, and this approach is often presented interchangeably with the actual
model (the SSF itself). However, reliance on conditional logistic regression
reduces model flexibility, and suggests a misleading interpretation of step
selection analysis as being equivalent to a case-control study. In this review,
we explicitly distinguish between model formulation and inference technique,
presenting a coherent framework to fit SSFs based on numerical integration and
maximum likelihood estimation. We provide an overview of common numerical
integration techniques, and explain how they relate to step selection analyses.
This framework unifies different model fitting techniques for SSFs, and opens
the way for improved inference. In particular, it makes it straightforward to
model movement with distributions outside the exponential family, and to apply
different SSF formulations to a data set and compare them with AIC. By
separating the model formulation from the inference technique, we hope to
clarify many important concepts in step selection analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15678v1

is achieved by comparing the time-varying speech stimuli and the elicited EEG
signals. However, in order to obtain reliable correlation values, these methods
necessitate a long decision window, resulting in a long detection latency.
Humans have a remarkable ability to recognize and follow a known speaker,
regardless of the spoken content. In this paper, we seek to detect the attended
speaker among the pre-enrolled speakers from the elicited EEG signals. In this
manner, we avoid relying on the speech stimuli for AAD at run-time. In doing
so, we propose a novel EEG-based attended speaker detection (E-ASD) task.
\textit{Methods:} We encode a speaker's voice with a fixed dimensional vector,
known as speaker embedding, and project it to an audio-derived voice signature,
which characterizes the speaker's unique voice regardless of the spoken
content. We hypothesize that such a voice signature also exists in the
listener's brain that can be decoded from the elicited EEG signals, referred to
as EEG-derived voice signature. By comparing the audio-derived voice signature
and the EEG-derived voice signature, we are able to effectively detect the
attended speaker in the listening brain. \textit{Results:} Experiments show
that E-ASD can effectively detect the attended speaker from the 0.5s EEG
decision windows, achieving 99.78\% AAD accuracy, 99.94\% AUC, and 0.27\% EER.
\textit{Conclusion:} We conclude that it is possible to derive the attended

may move from a microscope to a desktop. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining
is one of the most frequently used stains for disease analysis, diagnosis, and
grading, but pathologists do need different immunohistochemical (IHC) stains to
analyze specific structures or cells. Obtaining all of these stains (H&E and
different IHCs) on a single specimen is a tedious and time-consuming task.
Consequently, virtual staining has emerged as an essential research direction.
Here, we propose a novel generative model, Structural Cycle-GAN (SC-GAN), for
synthesizing IHC stains from H&E images, and vice versa. Our method expressly
incorporates structural information in the form of edges (in addition to color
data) and employs attention modules exclusively in the decoder of the proposed
generator model. This integration enhances feature localization and preserves
contextual information during the generation process. In addition, a structural
loss is incorporated to ensure accurate structure alignment between the
generated and input markers. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model,
experiments are conducted with two IHC markers emphasizing distinct structures
of glands in the colon: the nucleus of epithelial cells (CDX2) and the
cytoplasm (CK818). Quantitative metrics such as FID and SSIM are frequently
used for the analysis of generative models, but they do not correlate
explicitly with higher-quality virtual staining results. Therefore, we propose
two new quantitative metrics that correlate directly with the virtual staining
specificity of IHC markers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13182v1

toughness, lower toxicity, or better bioavailability has been a long-standing
challenge. In this context, we propose a molecular optimization framework
called Q-Drug (Quantum-inspired optimization algorithm for Drugs) that
leverages quantum-inspired algorithms to optimize molecules on discrete binary
domain variables. The framework begins by encoding the molecules into binary
embeddings using a discrete VAE. The binary embeddings are then used to
construct an Ising energy-like objective function, over which the
state-of-the-art quantum-inspired optimization algorithm is adopted to find the
optima. The binary embeddings corresponding to the optima are decoded to obtain
the optimized molecules. We have tested the framework for optimizing drug
molecule properties and have found that it outperforms other molecular
optimization methods, finding molecules with better properties in 1/20th to
1/10th of the time previously required. The framework can also be deployed

practical utility of video capsule endoscopy (VCE). Artificial intelligence

to address. Challenge #1: VCE data are stochastic and contains significant
artifact. Challenge #2: VCE interpretation is cost-intensive. Challenge #3: VCE
data are inherently imbalanced. Challenge #4: Existing VCE AIMLT are
computationally cumbersome. Challenge #5: Clinicians are hesitant to accept
AIMLT that cannot explain their process.
  Methods: An anatomic landmark detection model was used to test the
application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the task of classifying
VCE data. We also created a tool that assists in expert annotation of VCE data.
We then created more elaborate models using different approaches including a
multi-frame approach, a CNN based on graph representation, and a few-shot

  Results: When used on full-length VCE footage, CNNs accurately identified
anatomic landmarks (99.1%), with gradient weighted-class activation mapping

In this work, we reframe the age prediction problem from MR images to an
image-to-image regression problem where we estimate the brain age for each
brain voxel in MR images. We compare voxel-wise age prediction models against

adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Traditional Agatston score simply sums
the calcium, albeit in a non-linear way, leaving room for improved
calcification assessments that will more fully capture the extent of disease.
  Objective. To determine if AI methods using detailed calcification features
(i.e., calcium-omics) can improve MACE prediction.
  Methods. We investigated additional features of calcification including
assessment of mass, volume, density, spatial distribution, territory, etc. We
used a Cox model with elastic-net regularization on 2457 CT calcium score
(CTCS) enriched for MACE events obtained from a large no-cost CLARIFY program
(ClinicalTri-als.gov Identifier: NCT04075162). We employed sampling techniques
to enhance model training. We also investigated Cox models with selected
features to identify explainable high-risk characteristics.
  Results. Our proposed calcium-omics model with modified synthetic down
sampling and up sampling gave C-index (80.5%/71.6%) and two-year AUC
(82.4%/74.8%) for (80:20, training/testing), respectively (sampling was applied
to the training set only). Results compared favorably to Agatston which gave
C-index (71.3%/70.3%) and AUC (71.8%/68.8%), respectively. Among calcium-omics
features, numbers of calcifications, LAD mass, and diffusivity (a measure of
spatial distribution) were important determinants of increased risk, with dense
calcification (>1000HU) associated with lower risk. The calcium-omics model
reclassified 63% of MACE patients to the high risk group in a held-out test.

high-quality images that are indistinguishable from real images. Generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) are two of the
most prominent and widely studied generative models. GANs have demonstrated
excellent performance in generating sharp realistic images and VAEs have shown
strong abilities to generate diverse images. However, GANs suffer from ignoring
a large portion of the possible output space which does not represent the full
diversity of the target distribution, and VAEs tend to produce blurry images.
To fully capitalize on the strengths of both models while mitigating their
weaknesses, we employ a Bayesian non-parametric (BNP) approach to merge GANs
and VAEs. Our procedure incorporates both Wasserstein and maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) measures in the loss function to enable effective learning of
the latent space and generate diverse and high-quality samples. By fusing the

anomaly detection and data augmentation. Furthermore, we enhance the model's
capability by employing an extra generator in the code space, which enables us
to explore areas of the code space that the VAE might have overlooked. With a
BNP perspective, we can model the data distribution using an
infinite-dimensional space, which provides greater flexibility in the model and
reduces the risk of overfitting. By utilizing this framework, we can enhance

because it quantifies the flexibility of a fitting procedure and is
indispensable in model selection. The $\df$ is often intuitively equated with
the number of independent variables in the fitting procedure. But for adaptive
regressions that perform variable selection (e.g., the best subset
regressions), the model $\df$ is larger than the number of selected variables.
The excess part has been defined as the \emph{search degrees of freedom}
($\sdf$) to account for model selection. However, this definition is limited
since it does not consider fitting procedures in augmented space, such as
splines and regression trees; and it does not use the same fitting procedure
for $\sdf$ and $\df$. For example, the lasso's $\sdf$ is defined through the
\emph{relaxed} lasso's $\df$ instead of the lasso's $\df$.
  Here we propose a \emph{modified search degrees of freedom} ($\msdf$) to
directly account for the cost of searching in the original or augmented space.
Since many fitting procedures can be characterized by a linear operator, we
define the search cost as the effort to determine such a linear operator. When
we construct a linear operator for the lasso via the iterative ridge
regression, $\msdf$ offers a new perspective for its search cost. For some
complex procedures such as the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS),
the search cost needs to be pre-determined to serve as a tuning parameter for
the procedure itself, but it might be inaccurate. To investigate the inaccurate
pre-determined search cost, we develop two concepts, \emph{nominal} $\df$ and

2308.13564v1,econ.EM,SGMM: Stochastic Approximation to Generalized Method of Moments,2023-08-25 00:22:45+00:00,"We introduce a new class of algorithms, Stochastic Generalized Method of
Moments (SGMM), for estimation and inference on (overidentified) moment
restriction models. Our SGMM is a novel stochastic approximation alternative to
the popular Hansen (1982) (offline) GMM, and offers fast and scalable
implementation with the ability to handle streaming datasets in real time. We
establish the almost sure convergence, and the (functional) central limit
theorem for the inefficient online 2SLS and the efficient SGMM. Moreover, we
propose online versions of the Durbin-Wu-Hausman and Sargan-Hansen tests that
can be seamlessly integrated within the SGMM framework. Extensive Monte Carlo
simulations show that as the sample size increases, the SGMM matches the
standard (offline) GMM in terms of estimation accuracy and gains over
computational efficiency, indicating its practical value for both large-scale
and online datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by a proof of
concept using two well known empirical examples with large sample sizes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13564v1
2308.13068v1,cs.LG,Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection: Fancy Algorithms and Flawed Evaluation Methodology,2023-08-24 20:24:12+00:00,"Multivariate Time Series (MVTS) anomaly detection is a long-standing and
challenging research topic that has attracted tremendous research effort from
both industry and academia recently. However, a careful study of the literature
makes us realize that 1) the community is active but not as organized as other
sibling machine learning communities such as Computer Vision (CV) and Natural
Language Processing (NLP), and 2) most proposed solutions are evaluated using
either inappropriate or highly flawed protocols, with an apparent lack of
scientific foundation. So flawed is one very popular protocol, the so-called
\pa protocol, that a random guess can be shown to systematically outperform
\emph{all} algorithms developed so far. In this paper, we review and evaluate
many recent algorithms using more robust protocols and discuss how a normally
good protocol may have weaknesses in the context of MVTS anomaly detection and
how to mitigate them. We also share our concerns about benchmark datasets,
experiment design and evaluation methodology we observe in many works.
Furthermore, we propose a simple, yet challenging, baseline algorithm based on
Principal Components Analysis (PCA) that surprisingly outperforms many recent
Deep Learning (DL) based approaches on popular benchmark datasets. The main
objective of this work is to stimulate more effort towards important aspects of
the research such as data, experiment design, evaluation methodology and result
interpretability, instead of putting the highest weight on the design of
increasingly more complex and ""fancier"" algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13068v1
2308.13033v1,stat.CO,"A Strength and Sparsity Preserving Algorithm for Generating Weighted, Directed Networks with Predetermined Assortativity",2023-08-24 18:59:20+00:00,"Degree-preserving rewiring is a widely used technique for generating
unweighted networks with given assortativity, but for weighted networks, it is
unclear how an analog would preserve the strengths and other critical network
features such as sparsity level. This study introduces a novel approach for
rewiring weighted networks to achieve desired directed assortativity. The
method utilizes a mixed integer programming framework to establish a target
network with predetermined assortativity coefficients, followed by an efficient
rewiring algorithm termed ""strength and sparsity preserving rewiring"" (SSPR).
SSPR retains the node strength distributions and network sparsity after
rewiring. It is also possible to accommodate additional properties like edge
weight distribution with extra computational cost. The optimization scheme can
be used to determine feasible assortativity ranges for an initial network. The
effectiveness of the proposed SSPR algorithm is demonstrated through its
application to two classes of popular network models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13033v1
2308.12944v1,quant-ph,Parallel-in-time quantum simulation via Page and Wootters quantum time,2023-08-24 17:32:41+00:00,"In the past few decades, researchers have created a veritable zoo of quantum
algorithm by drawing inspiration from classical computing, information theory,
and even from physical phenomena. Here we present quantum algorithms for
parallel-in-time simulations that are inspired by the Page and Wooters
formalism. In this framework, and thus in our algorithms, the classical
time-variable of quantum mechanics is promoted to the quantum realm by
introducing a Hilbert space of ""clock"" qubits which are then entangled with the
""system"" qubits. We show that our algorithms can compute temporal properties
over $N$ different times of many-body systems by only using $\log(N)$ clock
qubits. As such, we achieve an exponential trade-off between time and spatial
complexities. In addition, we rigorously prove that the entanglement created
between the system qubits and the clock qubits has operational meaning, as it
encodes valuable information about the system's dynamics. We also provide a
circuit depth estimation of all the protocols, showing an exponential advantage
in computation times over traditional sequential in time algorithms. In
particular, for the case when the dynamics are determined by the Aubry-Andre
model, we present a hybrid method for which our algorithms have a depth that
only scales as $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)n)$. As a by product we can relate the
previous schemes to the problem of equilibration of an isolated quantum system,
thus indicating that our framework enable a new dimension for studying
dynamical properties of many-body systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.12944v1
2308.12470v1,stat.ME,Scalable Estimation of Multinomial Response Models with Uncertain Consideration Sets,2023-08-23 23:48:47+00:00,"A standard assumption in the fitting of unordered multinomial response models
for J mutually exclusive nominal categories, on cross-sectional or longitudinal
data, is that the responses arise from the same set of J categories between
subjects. However, when responses measure a choice made by the subject, it is
more appropriate to assume that the distribution of multinomial responses is
conditioned on a subject-specific consideration set, where this consideration
set is drawn from the power set of {1,2,...,J}. Because the cardinality of this
power set is exponential in J, estimation is infeasible in general. In this
paper, we provide an approach to overcoming this problem. A key step in the
approach is a probability model over consideration sets, based on a general
representation of probability distributions on contingency tables. Although the
support of this distribution is exponentially large, the posterior distribution
over consideration sets given parameters is typically sparse, and is easily
sampled as part of an MCMC scheme that iterates sampling of subject-specific
consideration sets given parameters, followed by parameters given consideration
sets. The effectiveness of the procedure is documented in simulated
longitudinal data sets with J=100 categories and real data from the cereal
market with J=73 brands.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.12470v1

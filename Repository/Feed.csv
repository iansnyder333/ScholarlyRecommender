2308.14608v1,cs.LG,AI in the Gray: Exploring Moderation Policies in Dialogic Large Language Models vs. Human Answers in Controversial Topics,2023-08-28 14:23:04+00:00,"The introduction of ChatGPT and the subsequent improvement of Large Language
Models (LLMs) have prompted more and more individuals to turn to the use of
ChatBots, both for information and assistance with decision-making. However,
the information the user is after is often not formulated by these ChatBots
objectively enough to be provided with a definite, globally accepted answer.
  Controversial topics, such as ""religion"", ""gender identity"", ""freedom of
speech"", and ""equality"", among others, can be a source of conflict as partisan
or biased answers can reinforce preconceived notions or promote disinformation.
By exposing ChatGPT to such debatable questions, we aim to understand its level
of awareness and if existing models are subject to socio-political and/or
economic biases. We also aim to explore how AI-generated answers compare to
human ones. For exploring this, we use a dataset of a social media platform
created for the purpose of debating human-generated claims on polemic subjects
among users, dubbed Kialo.
  Our results show that while previous versions of ChatGPT have had important
issues with controversial topics, more recent versions of ChatGPT
(gpt-3.5-turbo) are no longer manifesting significant explicit biases in
several knowledge areas. In particular, it is well-moderated regarding economic
aspects. However, it still maintains degrees of implicit libertarian leaning
toward right-winged ideals which suggest the need for increased moderation from
the socio-political point of view. In terms of domain knowledge on
controversial topics, with the exception of the ""Philosophical"" category,
ChatGPT is performing well in keeping up with the collective human level of
knowledge. Finally, we see that sources of Bing AI have slightly more tendency
to the center when compared to human answers. All the analyses we make are
generalizable to other types of biases and domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14608v1
2308.14921v1,cs.CL,Gender bias and stereotypes in Large Language Models,2023-08-28 22:32:05+00:00,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have made substantial progress in the past
several months, shattering state-of-the-art benchmarks in many domains. This
paper investigates LLMs' behavior with respect to gender stereotypes, a known
issue for prior models. We use a simple paradigm to test the presence of gender
bias, building on but differing from WinoBias, a commonly used gender bias
dataset, which is likely to be included in the training data of current LLMs.
We test four recently published LLMs and demonstrate that they express biased
assumptions about men and women's occupations. Our contributions in this paper
are as follows: (a) LLMs are 3-6 times more likely to choose an occupation that
stereotypically aligns with a person's gender; (b) these choices align with
people's perceptions better than with the ground truth as reflected in official
job statistics; (c) LLMs in fact amplify the bias beyond what is reflected in
perceptions or the ground truth; (d) LLMs ignore crucial ambiguities in
sentence structure 95% of the time in our study items, but when explicitly
prompted, they recognize the ambiguity; (e) LLMs provide explanations for their
choices that are factually inaccurate and likely obscure the true reason behind
their predictions. That is, they provide rationalizations of their biased
behavior. This highlights a key property of these models: LLMs are trained on
imbalanced datasets; as such, even with the recent successes of reinforcement
learning with human feedback, they tend to reflect those imbalances back at us.
As with other types of societal biases, we suggest that LLMs must be carefully
tested to ensure that they treat minoritized individuals and communities
equitably.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14921v1
2308.14752v1,cs.CY,"AI Deception: A Survey of Examples, Risks, and Potential Solutions",2023-08-28 17:59:35+00:00,"This paper argues that a range of current AI systems have learned how to
deceive humans. We define deception as the systematic inducement of false
beliefs in the pursuit of some outcome other than the truth. We first survey
empirical examples of AI deception, discussing both special-use AI systems
(including Meta's CICERO) built for specific competitive situations, and
general-purpose AI systems (such as large language models). Next, we detail
several risks from AI deception, such as fraud, election tampering, and losing
control of AI systems. Finally, we outline several potential solutions to the
problems posed by AI deception: first, regulatory frameworks should subject AI
systems that are capable of deception to robust risk-assessment requirements;
second, policymakers should implement bot-or-not laws; and finally,
policymakers should prioritize the funding of relevant research, including
tools to detect AI deception and to make AI systems less deceptive.
Policymakers, researchers, and the broader public should work proactively to
prevent AI deception from destabilizing the shared foundations of our society.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14752v1
2308.14359v1,cs.AI,Effect of Attention and Self-Supervised Speech Embeddings on Non-Semantic Speech Tasks,2023-08-28 07:11:27+00:00,"Human emotion understanding is pivotal in making conversational technology
mainstream. We view speech emotion understanding as a perception task which is
a more realistic setting. With varying contexts (languages, demographics, etc.)
different share of people perceive the same speech segment as a non-unanimous
emotion. As part of the ACM Multimedia 2023 Computational Paralinguistics
ChallengE (ComParE) in the EMotion Share track, we leverage their rich dataset
of multilingual speakers and multi-label regression target of 'emotion share'
or perception of that emotion. We demonstrate that the training scheme of
different foundation models dictates their effectiveness for tasks beyond
speech recognition, especially for non-semantic speech tasks like emotion
  understanding. This is a very complex task due to multilingual speakers,
variability in the target labels, and inherent imbalance in the regression
dataset. Our results show that HuBERT-Large with a self-attention-based
light-weight sequence model provides 4.6% improvement over the reported
baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14359v1
2308.14149v1,cs.CL,"Examining User-Friendly and Open-Sourced Large GPT Models: A Survey on Language, Multimodal, and Scientific GPT Models",2023-08-27 16:14:19+00:00,"Generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models have revolutionized the field
of natural language processing (NLP) with remarkable performance in various
tasks and also extend their power to multimodal domains. Despite their success,
large GPT models like GPT-4 face inherent limitations such as considerable
size, high computational requirements, complex deployment processes, and closed
development loops. These constraints restrict their widespread adoption and
raise concerns regarding their responsible development and usage. The need for
user-friendly, relatively small, and open-sourced alternative GPT models arises
from the desire to overcome these limitations while retaining high performance.
In this survey paper, we provide an examination of alternative open-sourced
models of large GPTs, focusing on user-friendly and relatively small models
that facilitate easier deployment and accessibility. Through this extensive
survey, we aim to equip researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts with a
thorough understanding of user-friendly and relatively small open-sourced
models of large GPTs, their current state, challenges, and future research
directions, inspiring the development of more efficient, accessible, and
versatile GPT models that cater to the broader scientific community and advance
the field of general artificial intelligence. The source contents are

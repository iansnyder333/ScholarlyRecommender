deceive humans. We define deception as the systematic inducement of false
beliefs in the pursuit of some outcome other than the truth. We first survey
empirical examples of AI deception, discussing both special-use AI systems
(including Meta's CICERO) built for specific competitive situations, and
general-purpose AI systems (such as large language models). Next, we detail
several risks from AI deception, such as fraud, election tampering, and losing
control of AI systems. Finally, we outline several potential solutions to the
problems posed by AI deception: first, regulatory frameworks should subject AI
systems that are capable of deception to robust risk-assessment requirements;
second, policymakers should implement bot-or-not laws; and finally,
policymakers should prioritize the funding of relevant research, including
tools to detect AI deception and to make AI systems less deceptive.
Policymakers, researchers, and the broader public should work proactively to
prevent AI deception from destabilizing the shared foundations of our society.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14752v1

computer vision applications. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that
photorealistic novel view synthesis is within reach, but was gated by
performance requirements for fast reconstruction of real scenes and objects.
Several recent approaches have built on alternative shape representations, in
particular, 3D Gaussians. We develop extensions to these renderers, such as
integrating differentiable optical flow, exporting watertight meshes and
rendering per-ray normals. Additionally, we show how two of the recent methods
are interoperable with each other. These reconstructions are quick, robust, and

of Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) in case of Bayesian
reasoning. The study draws inspiration from Zhu & Gigerenzer's research in
2006, which posed the question: Can children reason the Bayesian way? In the
pursuit of answering this question, a set of 10 Bayesian reasoning problems
were presented. The results of their work revealed that children's ability to
reason effectively using Bayesian principles is contingent upon a
well-structured information representation. In this paper, we present the same

Summaries are usually only a single sentence long, and yet form the backbone of
developer documentation. A short descriptions such as ""changes all visible
polygons to the color blue"" can give a programmer a high-level idea of what
code does without the effort of reading the code itself. Recently, products
based on Large Language Models such as ChatGPT have demonstrated a strong
ability to write these descriptions automatically. However, to use these tools,
programmers must send their code to untrusted third parties for processing
(e.g., via an API call). This loss of custody is not acceptable to many
organizations. In this paper, we present an alternative: we train an open
source model using sample output generated by GPT-3.5 in a process related to
knowledge distillation. Our model is small enough (350m parameters) to be run
on a single 16gb GPU, yet we show in our evaluation that it is large enough to
mimic GPT-3.5 on this task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14731v1

entails boundary discontinuity and spatial distortion. It severely deteriorates
the conventional CNNs and vision Transformers on panoramas. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective architecture named PanoSwin to learn panorama
representations with ERP. To deal with the challenges brought by
equirectangular projection, we explore a pano-style shift windowing scheme and
novel pitch attention to address the boundary discontinuity and the spatial
distortion, respectively. Besides, based on spherical distance and Cartesian
coordinates, we adapt absolute positional embeddings and relative positional
biases for panoramas to enhance panoramic geometry information. Realizing that
planar image understanding might share some common knowledge with panorama
understanding, we devise a novel two-stage learning framework to facilitate
knowledge transfer from the planar images to panoramas. We conduct experiments
against the state-of-the-art on various panoramic tasks, i.e., panoramic object

business, and weather. One of the main tasks of time series analysis, one that
helps to take informed decisions under uncertainty, is forecasting. Time series
are often hierarchically structured, e.g., a company sales might be broken down
into different regions, and each region into different stores. In some cases
the number of series in the hierarchy is too big to fit in a single model to
produce forecasts in relevant time, and a decentralized approach is beneficial.
  One way to do this is to train independent forecasting models for each series
and for some summary statistics series implied by the hierarchy (e.g. the sum
of all series) and to pass those models to a reconciliation algorithm to
improve those forecasts by sharing information between the series.
  In this work we focus on the reconciliation step, and propose a method to do
so from a Bayesian perspective - Bayesian forecast reconciliation. We also
define the common case of linear Gaussian reconciliation, where the forecasts
are Gaussian and the hierarchy has linear structure, and show that we can
compute reconciliation in closed form. We evaluate these methods on synthetic
and real data sets, and compare them to other work in this field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14719v1

introducing the fast feedforward (FFF) architecture, a logarithmic-time
alternative to feedforward networks.
  We show that FFFs give comparable performance to feedforward networks at an

performance compared to mixture-of-expert networks, and can readily take the
place of either in transformers.
  Pushing FFFs to the absolute limit, we train a vision transformer to perform

high-quality pseudo masks and a simple video synthesis method for model
training is surprisingly sufficient to enable the resulting video model to
effectively segment and track multiple instances across video frames. We show
the first competitive unsupervised learning results on the challenging
YouTubeVIS-2019 benchmark, achieving 50.7% APvideo^50 , surpassing the previous

2308.14622v1,cs.IR,TRIVEA: Transparent Ranking Interpretation using Visual Explanation of Black-Box Algorithmic Rankers,2023-08-28 16:58:44+00:00,"Ranking schemes drive many real-world decisions, like, where to study, whom
to hire, what to buy, etc. Many of these decisions often come with high
consequences. For example, a university can be deemed less prestigious if not
featured in a top-k list, and consumers might not even explore products that do
not get recommended to buyers. At the heart of most of these decisions are
opaque ranking schemes, which dictate the ordering of data entities, but their
internal logic is inaccessible or proprietary. Drawing inferences about the
ranking differences is like a guessing game to the stakeholders, like, the
rankees (i.e., the entities who are ranked, like product companies) and the
decision-makers (i.e., who use the rankings, like buyers). In this paper, we
aim to enable transparency in ranking interpretation by using algorithmic
rankers that learn from available data and by enabling human reasoning about
the learned ranking differences using explainable AI (XAI) methods. To realize
this aim, we leverage the exploration-explanation paradigm of human-data
interaction to let human stakeholders explore subsets and groupings of complex
multi-attribute ranking data using visual explanations of model fit and
attribute influence on rankings. We realize this explanation paradigm for
transparent ranking interpretation in TRIVEA, a visual analytic system that is
fueled by: i) visualizations of model fit derived from algorithmic rankers that
learn the associations between attributes and rankings from available data and
ii) visual explanations derived from XAI methods that help abstract important
patterns, like, the relative influence of attributes in different ranking
ranges. Using TRIVEA, end users not trained in data science have the agency to
transparently reason about the global and local behavior of the rankings
without the need to open black-box ranking models and develop confidence in the
resulting attribute-based inferences. We demonstrate the efficacy of TRIVEA
using multiple usage scenarios and subjective feedback from researchers with
diverse domain expertise. Keywords: Visual Analytics, Learning-to-Rank,

that impact the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC)

practitioners to gather in-depth responses and valuable insights into the
future opportunities for promoting the adoption, cultivation, and training of a
skilled workforce to leverage this technology effectively. A Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis revealed that safety and reliability are
significant factors for the adoption of AI-powered cobots in construction. Fear
of being replaced resulting from the use of cobots can have a substantial
effect on the mental health of the affected workers. A lower error rate in jobs
involving cobots, safety measurements, and security of data collected by cobots
from jobsites significantly impact reliability, while the transparency of
cobots' inner workings can benefit accuracy, robustness, security, privacy, and
communication, and results in higher levels of automation, all of which
demonstrated as contributors to trust. The study's findings provide critical

time-consuming, and error-prone processes. We introduce MELT, a new approach
that generates lightweight API migration rules directly from pull requests in
popular library repositories. Our key insight is that pull requests merged into
open-source libraries are a rich source of information sufficient to mine API
migration rules. By leveraging code examples mined from the library source and
automatically generated code examples based on the pull requests, we infer
transformation rules in \comby, a language for structural code search and
replace. Since inferred rules from single code examples may be too specific, we
propose a generalization procedure to make the rules more applicable to client
projects. MELT rules are syntax-driven, interpretable, and easily adaptable.
Moreover, unlike previous work, our approach enables rule inference to
seamlessly integrate into the library workflow, removing the need to wait for
client code migrations. We evaluated MELT on pull requests from four popular
libraries, successfully mining 461 migration rules from code examples in pull
requests and 114 rules from auto-generated code examples. Our generalization
procedure increases the number of matches for mined rules by 9x. We applied
these rules to client projects and ran their tests, which led to an overall
decrease in the number of warnings and fixing some test cases demonstrating
MELT's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14687v1

media platforms has become a critical area of research due to the growing
concerns about online safety, especially for vulnerable populations such as
children and adolescents. Researchers have been exploring various techniques
and approaches to develop effective detection systems that can identify and
mitigate these risks. Recent development of large language models (LLMs) has
opened a new opportunity to address this problem more effectively. This paper
proposes an approach to detection of online sexual predatory chats and abusive
language using the open-source pretrained Llama 2 7B-parameter model, recently
released by Meta GenAI. We fine-tune the LLM using datasets with different
sizes, imbalance degrees, and languages (i.e., English, Roman Urdu and Urdu).
Based on the power of LLMs, our approach is generic and automated without a
manual search for a synergy between feature extraction and classifier design
steps like conventional methods in this domain. Experimental results show a
strong performance of the proposed approach, which performs proficiently and
consistently across three distinct datasets with five sets of experiments. This
study's outcomes indicate that the proposed method can be implemented in
real-world applications (even with non-English languages) for flagging sexual
predators, offensive or toxic content, hate speech, and discriminatory language
in online discussions and comments to maintain respectful internet or digital
communities. Furthermore, it can be employed for solving text classification
problems with other potential applications such as sentiment analysis, spam and

which is a transformer-based encoder. It can recognize 50 different entity

a new therapeutic target in ulcerative colitis (UC). Diagnosis of histologic
remission currently relies on biopsy; during this process, patients are at risk
for bleeding, infection, and post-biopsy fibrosis. In addition, histologic
response scoring is complex and time-consuming, and there is heterogeneity
among pathologists. Endocytoscopy (EC) is a novel ultra-high magnification
endoscopic technique that can provide excellent in vivo assessment of glands.
Based on the EC technique, we propose a neural network model that can assess
histological disease activity in UC using EC images to address the above
issues. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can assist
patients in precise treatment and prognostic assessment.
  METHODS: We construct a neural network model for UC evaluation. A total of
5105 images of 154 intestinal segments from 87 patients undergoing EC treatment
at a center in China between March 2022 and March 2023 are scored according to
the Geboes score. Subsequently, 103 intestinal segments are used as the
training set, 16 intestinal segments are used as the validation set for neural
network training, and the remaining 35 intestinal segments are used as the test
set to measure the model performance together with the validation set.
  RESULTS: By treating HR as a negative category and histologic activity as a
positive category, the proposed neural network model can achieve an accuracy of
0.9, a specificity of 0.95, a sensitivity of 0.75, and an area under the curve
(AUC) of 0.81.
  CONCLUSION: We develop a specific neural network model that can distinguish
histologic remission/activity in EC images of UC, which helps to accelerate
clinical histological diagnosis.

study emphasizes the importance of early identification and prevention of
obesity-related health issues. Factors such as height, weight, waist
circumference, calorie intake, physical activity levels, and other relevant
health information need to be considered for developing robust algorithms for
obesity rate prediction and delivering personalized feedback. Hence, by
collecting health datasets from 321 adolescents, we proposed an adolescent
obesity prediction system that provides personalized predictions and assists
individuals in making informed health decisions. Our proposed deep learning
framework, DeepHealthNet, effectively trains the model using data augmentation
techniques, even when daily health data are limited, resulting in improved
prediction accuracy (acc: 0.8842). Additionally, the study revealed variations
in the prediction of the obesity rate between boys (acc: 0.9320) and girls

algorithms provide the potential to enable robots to learn optimal solutions to
complete new tasks without directly reprogramming them. The current
state-of-the-art in reinforcement learning, however, generally relies on fast

from radio telescopes, are transformed into images for observation of distant
celestial objects. However, these resultant images usually contain both real
sources and artifacts, due to signal sparsity and other factors. One way to
obtain cleaner images is to reconstruct samples into dense forms before
imaging. Unfortunately, existing visibility reconstruction methods may miss
some components of the frequency data, so blurred object edges and persistent
artifacts remain in the images. Furthermore, the computation overhead is high
on irregular visibility samples due to the data skew. To address these
problems, we propose PolarRec, a reconstruction method for interferometric
visibility data, which consists of a transformer-conditioned neural fields
pipeline with a polar coordinate representation. This representation matches
the way in which telescopes observe a celestial area as the Earth rotates. We
further propose Radial Frequency Loss function, using radial coordinates in the
polar coordinate system to correlate with the frequency information, to help
reconstruct complete visibility. We also group visibility sample points by
angular coordinates in the polar coordinate system, and use groups as the
granularity for subsequent encoding with a Transformer encoder. Consequently,
our method can capture the inherent characteristics of visibility data
effectively and efficiently. Our experiments demonstrate that PolarRec markedly
improves imaging results by faithfully reconstructing all frequency components

due to rare anomaly occurrences and data imbalance. A desirable characteristic
of an UAD model is contained generalization ability which excels in the
reconstruction of seen normal patterns but struggles with unseen anomalies.
Recent studies have pursued to contain the generalization capability of their
UAD models in reconstruction from different perspectives, such as design of
neural network (NN) structure and training strategy. In contrast, we note that
containing of generalization ability in reconstruction can also be obtained
simply from steep-shaped loss landscape. Motivated by this, we propose a loss
landscape sharpening method by amplifying the reconstruction loss, dubbed Loss
AMPlification (LAMP). LAMP deforms the loss landscape into a steep shape so the
reconstruction error on unseen anomalies becomes greater. Accordingly, the
anomaly detection performance is improved without any change of the NN
architecture. Our findings suggest that LAMP can be easily applied to any
reconstruction error metrics in UAD settings where the reconstruction model is
trained with anomaly-free samples only.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14595v1

being vulnerable to various adversarial attacks, compromising the vehicle's
safety, and posing danger to other road users. Rather than actively training
complex adversaries by interacting with the environment, there is a need to
first intelligently find and reduce the search space to only those states where
autonomous vehicles are found less confident. In this paper, we propose a
blackbox testing framework ReMAV using offline trajectories first to analyze
the existing behavior of autonomous vehicles and determine appropriate
thresholds for finding the probability of failure events. Our reward modeling
technique helps in creating a behavior representation that allows us to
highlight regions of likely uncertain behavior even when the baseline
autonomous vehicle is performing well. This approach allows for more efficient
testing without the need for computational and inefficient active adversarial
learning techniques. We perform our experiments in a high-fidelity urban
driving environment using three different driving scenarios containing single
and multi-agent interactions. Our experiment shows 35%, 23%, 48%, and 50%
increase in occurrences of vehicle collision, road objects collision,
pedestrian collision, and offroad steering events respectively by the
autonomous vehicle under test, demonstrating a significant increase in failure
events. We also perform a comparative analysis with prior testing frameworks
and show that they underperform in terms of training-testing efficiency,
finding total infractions, and simulation steps to identify the first failure

challenge of addressing uplink URLLC requirements in NOMA systems is related to
the combinatorial complexity of the action space due to the possibility to
schedule multiple devices, and to the partial observability constraint that we

be scalable. Our approach involves 1) formulating the NOMA-URLLC problem as a
Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and the introduction of an
agent state, serving as a sufficient statistic of past observations and
actions, enabling a transformation of the POMDP into a Markov Decision Process
(MDP); 2) adapting the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to handle
the combinatorial action space; 3) incorporating prior knowledge into the

large graph models. First, we discuss the desired characteristics of large
graph models. Then, we present detailed discussions from three key
perspectives: representation basis, graph data, and graph models. In each
category, we provide a brief overview of recent advances and highlight the
remaining challenges together with our visions. Finally, we discuss valuable

found in heterogeneous contexts. This means that agents operate in rapidly
changing environments and can be confronted with huge state and action spaces.
In order to perform services and carry out activities in a goal-oriented
manner, agents require prior knowledge and therefore have to develop and pursue
context-dependent policies. The problem is that prescribing policies in advance
is limited and inflexible, especially in dynamically changing environments.
Moreover, the context of an agent determines its choice of actions. Since the
environments in which agents operate can be stochastic and complex in terms of
the number of states and feasible actions, activities are usually modelled in a
simplified way by Markov decision processes so that agents with reinforcement
learning are able to learn policies that help to capture the context and act
accordingly to optimally perform activities. However, training policies for all
possible contexts using reinforcement learning is time-consuming. A requirement
and challenge for agents is to learn strategies quickly and respond immediately
in cross-context environments and applications. In this work, we propose a
novel simulation-based approach that enables a) the representation of
heterogeneous contexts through knowledge graphs and entity embeddings and b)
the context-aware composition of policies on demand by ensembles of agents
running in parallel. The evaluation we performed on the ""Virtual Home"" dataset
indicates that agents that need to seamlessly switch between different
contexts, can request on-the-fly composed policies that lead to the successful
completion of context-appropriate activities without having to learn these
policies in lengthy training steps and episodes, in contrast to agents that
apply reinforcement learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14521v1

control of arbitrary styles by leveraging natural language as emotion prompts.
This technique presents benefits in terms of both flexibility and

paired with several prompt-like descriptions.We propose an innovative automatic
annotation method, supported by Large Language Models (LLMs), to expedite the
dataset construction, thereby eliminating the substantial expense of manual
annotation. Following this, we utilize TEAD to train a CLIP-based model, termed
ExpCLIP, which encodes text and facial expressions into semantically aligned
style embeddings. The embeddings are subsequently integrated into the facial
animation generator to yield expressive and controllable facial animations.
Given the limited diversity of facial emotions in existing speech-driven facial

reconstruction for their precise sampling of complex distributions. In
SGM-based reconstruction, data consistency in the score-based diffusion model
ensures close adherence of generated samples to observed data distribution,
crucial for improving image quality. Shortcomings in data consistency
characterization manifest in three aspects. Firstly, data from the optimization
process can lead to artifacts in reconstructed images. Secondly, it often
neglects that the generation model and original data constraints are
independently completed, fragmenting unity. Thirdly, it predominantly focuses
on constraining intermediate results in the inverse sampling process, rather
than ideal real images. Thus, we propose an iterative optimization data scoring
model. This paper introduces the data-iterative optimization score-based model
(DOSM), integrating innovative data consistency into the Stochastic
Differential Equation, a valuable constraint for ultra-sparse-view CT
reconstruction. The novelty of this data consistency element lies in its sole
reliance on original measurement data to confine generation outcomes,
effectively balancing measurement data and generative model constraints.
Additionally, we pioneer an inference strategy that traces back from current
iteration results to ideal truth, enhancing reconstruction stability. We
leverage conventional iteration techniques to optimize DOSM updates.

semantic connection between different biomedical entities, which are useful in
identifying similar concepts in different textual contexts. To cope with

of a shield using the so-called barbaric method, where an approximate finite

extracted via systematically picked samples of the true transition function.
While hard safety guarantees are out of reach, we experimentally demonstrate
strong statistical safety guarantees with a prototype implementation and UPPAAL

applied as either a pre-shield (applied before learning a controller) or a

detection. Our investigation covers a set of six OOD techniques that employ
different detection strategies. These techniques are applied to models trained
in various ways and subsequently exposed to unknown malicious traffic from the

presents a frugal, model-based network that separates the low frequency from

Prior methodologies, although effective for image and audio modifications,

While this shift can enhance privacy and availability, it is hampered by the
enormous parameter sizes of these models, leading to impractical runtime costs.
In light of these considerations, we introduce EdgeMoE, the first on-device
inference engine tailored for mixture-of-expert (MoE) LLMs, a popular variant
of sparse LLMs that exhibit nearly constant computational complexity as their

efficiency by strategically partitioning the model across the storage

only when they are activated. This design is underpinned by a crucial insight
that expert weights, though voluminous, are infrequently accessed due to sparse
activation patterns. To further mitigate the overhead associated with expert
I/O swapping, EdgeMoE incorporates two innovative techniques: (1) Expert-wise
bitwidth adaptation: This method reduces the size of expert weights with an
acceptable level of accuracy loss. (2) Expert management: It predicts the
experts that will be activated in advance and preloads them into the

very few labeled data samples can be collected, which can lead to inferior
fairness performance. This is because existing fairness constraints are
designed to restrict the prediction disparity among different sensitive groups,
but with few samples, it becomes difficult to accurately measure the disparity,
thus rendering ineffective fairness optimization. In this paper, we define the

framework that accumulates fairness-aware knowledge across different
meta-training tasks and then generalizes the learned knowledge to meta-test
tasks. To compensate for insufficient training samples, we propose an essential
strategy to select and leverage an auxiliary set for each meta-test task. These
auxiliary sets contain several labeled training samples that can enhance the
model performance regarding fairness in meta-test tasks, thereby allowing for
the transfer of learned useful fairness-oriented knowledge to meta-test tasks.

vital role in patients' daily care, providing a holistic record of health,
diagnoses, and treatment. However, complex and verbose EHR narratives overload
healthcare providers, risking diagnostic inaccuracies. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) have showcased their potential in diverse language tasks, their
application in the healthcare arena needs to ensure the minimization of
diagnostic errors and the prevention of patient harm. In this paper, we outline
an innovative approach for augmenting the proficiency of LLMs in the realm of
automated diagnosis generation, achieved through the incorporation of a medical
knowledge graph (KG) and a novel graph model: Dr.Knows, inspired by the
clinical diagnostic reasoning process. We derive the KG from the National
Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), a robust
repository of biomedical knowledge. Our method negates the need for
pre-training and instead leverages the KG as an auxiliary instrument aiding in
the interpretation and summarization of complex medical concepts. Using
real-world hospital datasets, our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach of combining LLMs with KG has the potential to improve the

mood affects emotional and cognitive processing, and thus decision-making. It
follows that if a robot interacting with a person needs to predict the person's

potentially relevant feature. To date, however, there has not been any concrete
evidence that a robot can improve its human-interactive decision-making by
taking into account what the person is listening to. This research fills this
gap by reporting the results of an experiment in which human participants were
required to complete a task in the presence of an autonomous agent while
listening to background music. Specifically, the participants drove a simulated
car through an intersection while listening to music. The intersection was not
empty, as another simulated vehicle, controlled autonomously, was also crossing

Research in cultural psychology indicated significant differences in the

thinking that isolates things from their environment to analyze their nature

involving more than two entities. In scenarios where explicit hypergraphs are
not readily available, it is desirable to infer a meaningful hypergraph
structure from the node features to capture the intrinsic relations within the
data. However, existing methods either adopt simple pre-defined rules that fail
to precisely capture the distribution of the potential hypergraph structure, or
learn a mapping between hypergraph structures and node features but require a
large amount of labelled data, i.e., pre-existing hypergraph structures, for
training. Both restrict their applications in practical scenarios. To fill this
gap, we propose a novel smoothness prior that enables us to design a method to
infer the probability for each potential hyperedge without labelled data as
supervision. The proposed prior indicates features of nodes in a hyperedge are
highly correlated by the features of the hyperedge containing them. We use this
prior to derive the relation between the hypergraph structure and the node
features via probabilistic modelling. This allows us to develop an unsupervised
inference method to estimate the probability for each potential hyperedge via
solving an optimisation problem that has an analytical solution. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can learn
meaningful hypergraph structures from data more efficiently than existing
hypergraph structure inference methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14172v1

data, employing off-policy evaluation methods to estimate their expected
performance. However, for strategies that present users with slates of multiple
items, the resulting combinatorial action space renders many of these methods
impractical. Prior work has developed estimators that leverage the structure in
slates to estimate the expected off-policy performance, but the estimation of
the entire performance distribution remains elusive. Estimating the complete
distribution allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of recommendation
strategies, particularly along the axes of risk and fairness that employ
metrics computable from the distribution. In this paper, we propose an
estimator for the complete off-policy performance distribution for slates and
establish conditions under which the estimator is unbiased and consistent. This
builds upon prior work on off-policy evaluation for slates and off-policy
distribution estimation in reinforcement learning. We validate the efficacy of
our method empirically on synthetic data as well as on a slate recommendation
simulator constructed from real-world data (MovieLens-20M). Our results show a
significant reduction in estimation variance and improved sample efficiency

way of giving insights into the reasons behind a classification decision. This
is of particular interest in decision-critical domains, such as medical
diagnostics. One particular challenging use case is to distinguish facial
expressions of pain and other states, such as disgust, due to high similarity
of manifestation. In this paper, we present an approach for generating
contrastive explanations to explain facial expressions of pain and disgust
shown in video sequences. We implement and compare two approaches for
contrastive explanation generation. The first approach explains a specific pain
instance in contrast to the most similar disgust instance(s) based on the
occurrence of facial expressions (attributes). The second approach takes into
account which temporal relations hold between intervals of facial expressions
within a sequence (relations). The input to our explanation generation approach
is the output of an interpretable rule-based classifier for pain and disgust.We
utilize two different similarity metrics to determine near misses and far
misses as contrasting instances. Our results show that near miss explanations
are shorter than far miss explanations, independent from the applied similarity
metric. The outcome of our evaluation indicates that pain and disgust can be
distinguished with the help of temporal relations. We currently plan
experiments to evaluate how the explanations help in teaching concepts and how
they could be enhanced by further modalities and interaction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14163v1

the corresponding face frame for emotion representation learning with minimal
modality-specific design. Our UBVMT model is trained by reconstructing masked
patches of video frames and 2D images of ECG/PPG signals, and contrastive

This maneuver confuses the protective mechanisms and tricks the model into

characters within a video according to their identities. To this end, recent
works have evolved from unsupervised clustering to graph-based supervised
clustering. However, graph methods are built upon the premise of fixed affinity
graphs, bringing many inexact connections. Besides, they extract multi-modal
features with kinds of models, which are unfriendly to deployment. In this
paper, we present a unified and dynamic graph (UniDG) framework for temporal
character grouping. This is accomplished firstly by a unified representation
network that learns representations of multiple modalities within the same
space and still preserves the modality's uniqueness simultaneously. Secondly,
we present a dynamic graph clustering where the neighbors of different
quantities are dynamically constructed for each node via a cyclic matching
strategy, leading to a more reliable affinity graph. Thirdly, a progressive
association method is introduced to exploit spatial and temporal contexts among
different modalities, allowing multi-modal clustering results to be well fused.
As current datasets only provide pre-extracted features, we evaluate our UniDG
method on a collected dataset named MTCG, which contains each character's

processing of endoscopic view. However, existing DL models may suffer from
catastrophic forgetting. When new target classes are introduced over time or
cross institutions, the performance of old classes may suffer severe
degradation. More seriously, data privacy and storage issues may lead to the
unavailability of old data when updating the model. Therefore, it is necessary
to develop a continual learning (CL) methodology to solve the problem of
catastrophic forgetting in endoscopic image segmentation. To tackle this, we
propose a Endoscopy Continual Semantic Segmentation (EndoCSS) framework that
does not involve the storage and privacy issues of exemplar data. The framework
includes a mini-batch pseudo-replay (MB-PR) mechanism and a self-adaptive noisy
cross-entropy (SAN-CE) loss. The MB-PR strategy circumvents privacy and storage
issues by generating pseudo-replay images through a generative model.
Meanwhile, the MB-PR strategy can also correct the model deviation to the
replay data and current training data, which is aroused by the significant
difference in the amount of current and replay images. Therefore, the model can
perform effective representation learning on both new and old tasks. SAN-CE
loss can help model fitting by adjusting the model's output logits, and also
improve the robustness of training. Extensive continual semantic segmentation

edge models from inefficient pre-trained backbones that are leveraged by most
existing deep learning methods, for saving the computational cost and cutting
the model size; and 2) How to mitigate the negative influence from noisy or

systematic design of materials with the aid of integrated computational
materials engineering (ICME) approaches. However, obtaining three-dimensional
(3D) microstructure datasets is often challenging due to high experimental
costs or technical limitations, while acquiring two-dimensional (2D)
micrographs is comparatively easier. To deal with this issue, this study
proposes a novel framework for 2D-to-3D reconstruction of microstructures
called Micro3Diff using diffusion-based generative models (DGMs). Specifically,
this approach solely requires pre-trained DGMs for the generation of 2D
samples, and dimensionality expansion (2D-to-3D) takes place only during the
generation process (i.e., reverse diffusion process). The proposed framework
incorporates a new concept referred to as multi-plane denoising diffusion,
which transforms noisy samples (i.e., latent variables) from different planes
into the data structure while maintaining spatial connectivity in 3D space.
Furthermore, a harmonized sampling process is developed to address possible
deviations from the reverse Markov chain of DGMs during the dimensionality
expansion. Combined, we demonstrate the feasibility of Micro3Diff in
reconstructing 3D samples with connected slices that maintain morphologically
equivalence to the original 2D images. To validate the performance of
Micro3Diff, various types of microstructures (synthetic and experimentally
observed) are reconstructed, and the quality of the generated samples is
assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The successful reconstruction
outcomes inspire the potential utilization of Micro3Diff in upcoming ICME

applying deep networks to real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles,
mobile devices, robotics, and edge computing. However, the challenge remains
that state-of-the-art models usually demand significant computational
resources, leading to impractical power consumption, latency, or carbon
emissions in real-world scenarios. This trade-off between effectiveness and
efficiency has catalyzed the emergence of a new research focus: computationally
efficient deep learning, which strives to achieve satisfactory performance
while minimizing the computational cost during inference. This review offers an
extensive analysis of this rapidly evolving field by examining four key areas:
1) the development of static or dynamic light-weighted backbone models for the
efficient extraction of discriminative deep representations; 2) the specialized
network architectures or algorithms tailored for specific computer vision
tasks; 3) the techniques employed for compressing deep learning models; and 4)
the strategies for deploying efficient deep networks on hardware platforms.
Additionally, we provide a systematic discussion on the critical challenges
faced in this domain, such as network architecture design, training schemes,
practical efficiency, and more realistic model compression approaches, as well
as potential future research directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13998v1

has been the default choice in the literature of multi-task learning (MTL)
since its inception. In recent years, there is a surge of interest in
developing Specialized Multi-Task Optimizers (SMTOs) that treat MTL as a
multi-objective optimization problem. However, it remains open whether there is
a fundamental advantage of SMTOs over scalarization. In fact, heated debates
exist in the community comparing these two types of algorithms, mostly from an
empirical perspective. To approach the above question, in this paper, we
revisit scalarization from a theoretical perspective. We focus on linear MTL
models and study whether scalarization is capable of fully exploring the Pareto
front. Our findings reveal that, in contrast to recent works that claimed
empirical advantages of scalarization, scalarization is inherently incapable of
full exploration, especially for those Pareto optimal solutions that strike the
balanced trade-offs between multiple tasks. More concretely, when the model is
under-parametrized, we reveal a multi-surface structure of the feasible region
and identify necessary and sufficient conditions for full exploration. This
leads to the conclusion that scalarization is in general incapable of tracing
out the Pareto front. Our theoretical results partially answer the open
questions in Xin et al. (2021), and provide a more intuitive explanation on why
scalarization fails beyond non-convexity. We additionally perform experiments
on a real-world dataset using both scalarization and state-of-the-art SMTOs.
The experimental results not only corroborate our theoretical findings, but
also unveil the potential of SMTOs in finding balanced solutions, which cannot
be achieved by scalarization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13985v1

pre-trained SAM and fine-tuned SAM on bloodstain image segmentation with
diverse image backgrounds. Experiment results indicate that both pre-trained

satisfactory accuracy and efficiency, while fine-tuned SAM achieves an overall
2.2\% accuracy improvement than pre-trained SAM and 4.70\% acceleration in
terms of speed for image recognition. Analysis of factors that influence
bloodstain recognition is carried out. This research demonstrates the potential

model various NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems in the form of binary

this study, we investigate how reinforcement learning-based (RL) paradigms with
the presence of the Hamiltonian function can address combinatorial optimization
problems over graphs in QUBO formulations. We use Graph Neural Network (GNN) as
the message-passing architecture to convey the information among the nodes. We
have centered our discussion on QUBO formulated Max-Cut problem but the
intuitions can be extended to any QUBO supported canonical NP-Hard
combinatorial optimization problems. We mainly investigate three formulations,
Monty-Carlo Tree Search with GNN-based RL (MCTS-GNN), DQN with GNN-based RL,
and a generic GNN with attention-based RL (GRL). Our findings state that in the
RL-based paradigm, the Hamiltonian function-based optimization in QUBO
formulation brings model convergence and can be used as a generic reward
function. We also analyze and present the performance of our RL-based setups
through experimenting over graphs of different densities and compare them with
a simple GNN-based setup in the light of constraint violation, learning
stability and computation cost. As per one of our findings, all the
architectures provide a very comparable performance in sparse graphs as per the
number of constraint violation whreas MCTS-GNN gives the best performance. In
the similar criteria, the performance significantly starts to drop both for GRL

empirical study, we find that different models make relatively similar

much more across different models. Motivated by this observation, we propose
\em denoising with cross-model agreement \em (DeCA) which aims to minimize the
KL-divergence between the true label distributions parameterized by two machine
learning models while maximizing the likelihood of data observation. We employ
the proposed DeCA on both the binary label scenario and the multiple label

recommendation as the downstream task and conduct experiments with four
state-of-the-art recommendation models on four datasets. For the multiple-label

personalized locally on individual clients. Federated learning enables multiple
clients to collaborate to train a model without sharing data. Clients with
insufficient data or data diversity participate in federated learning to learn
a model with superior performance. Nonetheless, learning suffers when data
distributions diverge. There is a need to learn a global model that can be
adapted using client's specific information to create personalised models on
clients is required. MRI data suffers from this problem, wherein, one, due to
data acquisition challenges, local data at a site is sufficient for training an
accurate model and two, there is a restriction of data sharing due to privacy
concerns and three, there is a need for personalization of a learnt shared
global model on account of domain shift across client sites. The global model
is sparse and captures the common features in the MRI. This skeleton network is
grown on each client to train a personalised model by learning additional
client-specific parameters from local data. Experimental results show that the
personalization process at each client quickly converges using a limited number
of epochs. The personalized client models outperformed the locally trained

ViT attention weights, we reveal the dynamics of overlap across individual

tasks in spoken language understanding. Motivated by the fact that the two

the model to transfer information between the two tasks so that the result of
one task can correct the result of the other. In addition, since a joint model

language models due to its strong downstream task performance and efficient
multitask serving ability. Despite its wide adoption, we empirically show that
prompt-tuning is vulnerable to downstream task-agnostic backdoors, which reside
in the pretrained models and can affect arbitrary downstream tasks. The
state-of-the-art backdoor detection approaches cannot defend against
task-agnostic backdoors since they hardly converge in reversing the backdoor
triggers. To address this issue, we propose LMSanitator, a novel approach for
detecting and removing task-agnostic backdoors on Transformer models. Instead
of directly inversing the triggers, LMSanitator aims to inverse the predefined
attack vectors (pretrained models' output when the input is embedded with
triggers) of the task-agnostic backdoors, which achieves much better
convergence performance and backdoor detection accuracy. LMSanitator further
leverages prompt-tuning's property of freezing the pretrained model to perform
accurate and fast output monitoring and input purging during the inference
phase. Extensive experiments on multiple language models and NLP tasks
illustrate the effectiveness of LMSanitator. For instance, LMSanitator achieves
92.8% backdoor detection accuracy on 960 models and decreases the attack
success rate to less than 1% in most scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13904v1

mathematical equations to derive solutions. Existing works focus on solving
MWPs with two types of solvers: tree-based solver and large language model

which will bring the following problems: (1) Single type of solver is hard to
solve all types of MWPs well. (2) A single solver will result in poor
performance due to over-fitting. To address these challenges, this paper
utilizes multiple ensemble approaches to improve MWP-solving ability. Firstly,
We propose a problem type classifier that combines the strengths of the

respective advantages and broadens the range of MWPs that can be solved.
Furthermore, we also apply ensemble techniques to both tree-based solver and

maintain source code. Unfortunately, these summaries are often missing or
outdated in software projects. Code summarization aims to generate natural
language descriptions automatically for source code. Code summaries are highly
structured and have repetitive patterns. Besides the patternized words, a code
summary also contains important keywords, which are the key to reflecting the
functionality of the code. However, the state-of-the-art approaches perform
poorly on predicting the keywords, which leads to the generated summaries
suffering a loss in informativeness. To alleviate this problem, this paper
proposes a novel retrieve-and-edit approach named EditSum for code
summarization. Specifically, EditSum first retrieves a similar code snippet
from a pre-defined corpus and treats its summary as a prototype summary to
learn the pattern. Then, EditSum edits the prototype automatically to combine
the pattern in the prototype with the semantic information of input code. Our
motivation is that the retrieved prototype provides a good start-point for
post-generation because the summaries of similar code snippets often have the
same pattern. The post-editing process further reuses the patternized words in
the prototype and generates keywords based on the semantic information of input
code. We conduct experiments on a large-scale Java corpus and experimental
results demonstrate that EditSum outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by
a substantial margin. The human evaluation also proves the summaries generated

search error. Plenty of research has investigated a range of beam widths, from
small to large, and reported that a beam width that is neither too large nor
too small is desirable. However, in terms of search depth, only the two extreme
ends, beam search and exhaustive search are studied intensively. In this paper,
we examine a range of search depths between the two extremes to discover the
desirable search depth. To this end, we introduce Lookahead Beam Search (LBS),
a multi-step lookahead search that optimizes the objective considering a fixed

LBS where the lookahead depth is set to $0$ and $\infty$, respectively. We
empirically evaluate the performance of LBS and find that it outperforms beam
search overall on machine translation tasks. The result suggests there is room

accumulating knowledge in a DNN from a growing data stream. A major challenge
in CL is that non-stationary data streams cause catastrophic forgetting of
previously learned abilities. Rehearsal is a popular and effective way to
mitigate this problem, which is storing past observations in a buffer and
mixing them with new observations during learning. This leads to a question:
Which stored samples should be selected for rehearsal? Choosing samples that
are best for learning, rather than simply selecting them at random, could lead
to significantly faster learning. For class incremental learning, prior work
has shown that a simple class balanced random selection policy outperforms more
sophisticated methods. Here, we revisit this question by exploring a new sample
selection policy called GRASP. GRASP selects the most prototypical (class
representative) samples first and then gradually selects less prototypical

the text using the LM and an entropy encoder. Alternately, the resulting set is
an approximation via a causal LM to the set of phrases that minimize the

linguistics based on suggestions by Gries (2006, 2022). Traditional approaches
based on hypothesis tests (e.g. Likelihood Ratio) model the copora as
independent identically distributed samples of tokens. This model does not
account for the often observed uneven distribution of occurences of a word
across a corpus. When occurences of a word are concentrated in few documents,
large values of LLR and similar scores are in fact much more likely than
accounted for by the token-by-token sampling model, leading to false positives.
  We replace the token-by-token sampling model by a model where corpora are
samples of documents rather than tokens, which is much closer to the way
corpora are actually assembled. We then use a permutation approach to
approximate the distribution of a given keyness score under the null hypothesis
of equal frequencies and obtain p-values for assessing significance. We do not
need any assumption on how the tokens are organized within or across documents,
and the approach works with basically *any* keyness score. Hence, appart from
obtaining more accurate p-values for scores like LLR, we can also assess
significance for e.g. the logratio which has been proposed as a measure of
effect size.
  An efficient implementation of the proposed approach is provided in the `R`

the generated text manifests itself in multiple aspects, each of which is hard
to measure individually: style transfer accuracy, content preservation, and
overall fluency of the text. Human evaluation is the gold standard in TST
evaluation; however, it is expensive, and the results are difficult to
reproduce. Numerous automated metrics are employed to assess performance in
these aspects, serving as substitutes for human evaluation. However, the
correlation between many of these automated metrics and human evaluations
remains unclear, raising doubts about their effectiveness as reliable
benchmarks. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their ability to not only match but also surpass the average human
performance across a wide range of unseen tasks. This suggests that LLMs have
the potential to serve as a viable alternative to human evaluation and other
automated metrics. We assess the performance of different LLMs on TST
evaluation by employing multiple input prompts and comparing their results. Our
findings indicate that (even zero-shot) prompting correlates strongly with
human evaluation and often surpasses the performance of (other) automated
metrics. Additionally, we propose the ensembling of prompts and show it

shown great success by jointly learning acoustic and linguistic information, it
still suffers from the effect of domain shifts, thus limiting potential
applications. The E2E ASR model implicitly learns an internal language model
(LM) which characterises the training distribution of the source domain, and
the E2E trainable nature makes the internal LM difficult to adapt to the target
domain with text-only data To solve this problem, this paper proposes decoupled
structures for attention-based encoder-decoder (Decoupled-AED) and neural
transducer (Decoupled-Transducer) models, which can achieve flexible domain
adaptation in both offline and online scenarios while maintaining robust
intra-domain performance. To this end, the acoustic and linguistic parts of the
E2E model decoder (or prediction network) are decoupled, making the linguistic
component (i.e. internal LM) replaceable. When encountering a domain shift, the
internal LM can be directly replaced during inference by a target-domain LM,
without re-training or using domain-specific paired speech-text data.
Experiments for E2E ASR models trained on the LibriSpeech-100h corpus showed

encoding steps, and finally selects the most representative hidden states from
the encoder for the decoding process. To extract inter-chunk semantic
information, we align the start and end token embeddings among chunks in each
encoding transformer block. To learn an effective hidden selection policy, we
design a dual updating scheme inspired by reinforcement learning, which regards
the decoders of transformers as environments, and the downstream performance
metrics as the rewards to evaluate the hidden selection actions. Our empirical

performance of a classifier is really due to spurious correlations in the data

subtle target signals and in challenging (low resource) data settings. We focus
on topic-based spurious correlation and approach the question from two
directions: (i) where we have no knowledge about spurious topic information and
its distribution in the data, (ii) where we have some indication about the
nature of spurious topic correlations. For (i) we develop a measure from first
principles capturing alignment of unsupervised topics with target
classification labels as an indication of spurious topic information in the

leads to low performance and fails to deal with extremely low-bit quantization.
To tackle this issue, we introduce an Omnidirectionally calibrated Quantization
(OmniQuant) technique for LLMs, which achieves good performance in diverse
quantization settings while maintaining the computational efficiency of PTQ by
efficiently optimizing various quantization parameters. OmniQuant comprises two
innovative components including Learnable Weight Clipping (LWC) and Learnable
Equivalent Transformation (LET). LWC modulates the extreme values of weights by
optimizing the clipping threshold. Meanwhile, LET tackles activation outliers
by shifting the challenge of quantization from activations to weights through a
learnable equivalent transformation. Operating within a differentiable
framework using block-wise error minimization, OmniQuant can optimize the
quantization process efficiently for both weight-only and weight-activation
quantization. For instance, the LLaMA-2 model family with the size of 7-70B can
be processed with OmniQuant on a single A100-40G GPU within 1-16 hours using
128 samples. Extensive experiments validate OmniQuant's superior performance
across diverse quantization configurations such as W4A4, W6A6, W4A16, W3A16,

science is no different. In natural science, traditional manual, serial, and

more. To add new capabilities in natural science, enabling the acceleration and
enrichment of automation of the discovery process, we present DARWIN, a series
of tailored LLMs for natural science, mainly in physics, chemistry, and
material science. This series relies on open-source LLM, incorporating
structured and unstructured scientific knowledge from public datasets and

emphasizing factual correctness. During the fine-tuning, we introduce the
Scientific Instruction Generation (SIG) model, automating instruction
generation from scientific texts. This eliminates the need for manual
extraction or domain-specific knowledge graphs and efficiently injects
scientific knowledge into the model. We also explore multi-task training
strategies, revealing interconnections between scientific tasks. DARWIN series

using text analysis is a common practice. With recent advancements of large
language models (LLM), it would be useful to know how the popular LLM
interfaces perform in classifying or extracting information from crash
narratives. To explore this, our study has used the three most popular publicly
available LLM interfaces- ChatGPT, BARD and GPT4. This study investigated their
usefulness and boundaries in extracting information and answering queries
related to accidents from 100 crash narratives from Iowa and Kansas. During the
investigation, their capabilities and limitations were assessed and their
responses to the queries were compared. Five questions were asked related to
the narratives: 1) Who is at-fault? 2) What is the manner of collision? 3) Has
the crash occurred in a work-zone? 4) Did the crash involve pedestrians? and 5)
What are the sequence of harmful events in the crash? For questions 1 through
4, the overall similarity among the LLMs were 70%, 35%, 96% and 89%,
respectively. The similarities were higher while answering direct questions
requiring binary responses and significantly lower for complex questions. To
compare the responses to question 5, network diagram and centrality measures
were analyzed. The network diagram from the three LLMs were not always similar
although they sometimes have the same influencing events with high in-degree,
out-degree and betweenness centrality. This study suggests using multiple

prompting numerous LLMs to perform the same tasks and then conducting a
majority vote on the resulting outputs. This method achieves improved results
to any one model in the ensemble on one-shot rare disease identification and
classification tasks. We also release a novel rare disease dataset for FSL,

Structural Causal Model (SCM) to induce the underlying causal structure of the
summarization data. We assume several latent causal factors and non-causal
factors, representing the content and style of the document and summary.
Theoretically, we prove that the latent factors in our SCM can be identified by
fitting the observed training data under certain conditions. On the basis of
this, we propose a Causality Inspired Sequence-to-Sequence model (CI-Seq2Seq)

truths provided by the ML model, which classifies the transmitter node as
legitimate or malicious. Moreover, we consider the probability of false alarm
and the probability of missed detection as performance metrics resulting from
the binary hypothesis testing, and mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error

deep learning for condition monitoring tasks using an AutoML toolbox. The
experiments reveal consistent high accuracy in random K-fold cross-validation
scenarios across all tested models. However, when employing leave-one-group-out

indicating the presence of domain shift in real-world scenarios. Additionally,
the study assesses the scalability and interpretability of conventional methods

modular structure aiding feature identification. In contrast, neural networks
require specialized interpretation techniques like occlusion maps to visualize
important regions in the input data. Finally, the paper highlights the
significance of feature selection, particularly in condition monitoring tasks
with limited class variations. Low-complexity models prove sufficient for such
tasks, as only a few features from the input signal are typically needed. In

deliberately disseminate wrong messages to their neighbors so as to bias the

privacy-preserving and Byzantine-robust decentralized stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) framework, in which Gaussian noise is injected to preserve
privacy and robust aggregation rules are adopted to counteract Byzantine
attacks. We analyze its learning error and privacy guarantee, discovering an
essential tradeoff between privacy preservation and Byzantine-robustness in
decentralized learning -- the learning error caused by defending against
Byzantine attacks is exacerbated by the Gaussian noise added to preserve
privacy. Numerical experiments are conducted and corroborate our theoretical

in helping users navigate and discover content within their vast musical
databases. At odds with this larger goal, is the presence of popularity bias,
which causes algorithmic systems to favor mainstream content over, potentially
more relevant, but niche items. In this work we explore the intrinsic
relationship between music discovery and popularity bias. To mitigate this
issue we propose a domain-aware, individual fairness-based approach which
addresses popularity bias in graph neural network (GNNs) based recommender
systems. Our approach uses individual fairness to reflect a ground truth
listening experience, i.e., if two songs sound similar, this similarity should
be reflected in their representations. In doing so, we facilitate meaningful
music discovery that is robust to popularity bias and grounded in the music
domain. We apply our BOOST methodology to two discovery based tasks, performing
recommendations at both the playlist level and user level. Then, we ground our
evaluation in the cold start setting, showing that our approach outperforms
existing fairness benchmarks in both performance and recommendation of
lesser-known content. Finally, our analysis explains why our proposed
methodology is a novel and promising approach to mitigating popularity bias and
improving the discovery of new and niche content in music recommender systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14601v1

approaching the point where these models do not have to be finetuned

head. Critically, given the complexity of working at this scale, there is a
bottleneck where relatively few organizations in the world are executing the
training then sharing the models on centralized platforms such as HuggingFace

generalize well to new, unseen domains, especially when training data is

samples stochastically in the latent space, mapping them to augmented labels,
and then restores the samples from their corrupted versions during training.
This process confuses the classifier in the degradation step and restores the
overall class distribution of the original samples, promoting diverse
intra-class/cross-domain variability. We extensively evaluate our approach on a
diverse set of datasets and tasks, including domain generalization benchmarks
and medical imaging datasets with strong domain shift, where we show our
approach achieves significant improvements over existing methods for latent
space augmentation. We further show that our method can be flexibly adapted to

recurrent neural networks (RNN) as the number of hidden units, data samples in
the sequence, hidden state updates, and training steps simultaneously grow to
infinity. In the case of an RNN with a simplified weight matrix, we prove the
convergence of the RNN to the solution of an infinite-dimensional ODE coupled
with the fixed point of a random algebraic equation. The analysis requires
addressing several challenges which are unique to RNNs. In typical mean-field
applications (e.g., feedforward neural networks), discrete updates are of
magnitude $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{N})$ and the number of updates is
$\mathcal{O}(N)$. Therefore, the system can be represented as an Euler
approximation of an appropriate ODE/PDE, which it will converge to as $N
\rightarrow \infty$. However, the RNN hidden layer updates are
$\mathcal{O}(1)$. Therefore, RNNs cannot be represented as a discretization of
an ODE/PDE and standard mean-field techniques cannot be applied. Instead, we
develop a fixed point analysis for the evolution of the RNN memory states, with
convergence estimates in terms of the number of update steps and the number of
hidden units. The RNN hidden layer is studied as a function in a Sobolev space,
whose evolution is governed by the data sequence (a Markov chain), the
parameter updates, and its dependence on the RNN hidden layer at the previous
time step. Due to the strong correlation between updates, a Poisson equation
must be used to bound the fluctuations of the RNN around its limit equation.
These mathematical methods give rise to the neural tangent kernel (NTK) limits

generalized linear model. Spectral methods are a simple yet effective approach
for estimation: they estimate the parameter via the principal eigenvector of a
matrix obtained by suitably preprocessing the observations. Despite their wide
use, a rigorous performance characterization of spectral estimators, as well as
a principled way to preprocess the data, is available only for unstructured
(i.e., i.i.d. Gaussian and Haar) designs. In contrast, real-world design
matrices are highly structured and exhibit non-trivial correlations. To address
this problem, we consider correlated Gaussian designs which capture the
anisotropic nature of the measurements via a feature covariance matrix
$\Sigma$. Our main result is a precise asymptotic characterization of the
performance of spectral estimators in this setting. This then allows to
identify the optimal preprocessing that minimizes the number of samples needed
to meaningfully estimate the parameter. Remarkably, such an optimal spectral
estimator depends on $\Sigma$ only through its normalized trace, which can be
consistently estimated from the data. Numerical results demonstrate the
advantage of our principled approach over previous heuristic methods.
  Existing analyses of spectral estimators crucially rely on the rotational
invariance of the design matrix. This key assumption does not hold for
correlated Gaussian designs. To circumvent this difficulty, we develop a novel
strategy based on designing and analyzing an approximate message passing
algorithm whose fixed point coincides with the desired spectral estimator. Our
methodology is general, and opens the way to the precise characterization of
spiked matrices and of the corresponding spectral methods in a variety of

that mitigate these effects. In this paper, we propose a novel problem
formulation aimed at slightly nudging users' social feeds in order to strike a
balance between relevance and diversity, thus mitigating the emergence of
polarization, without lowering the quality of the feed. Our approach is based
on re-weighting the relative importance of the accounts that a user follows, so
as to calibrate the frequency with which the content produced by various

problem, demonstrating the non-matrix convexity of the objective function and
the convexity of the feasible set. To efficiently address the problem, we
develop a scalable algorithm based on projected gradient descent. We also prove
that our problem statement is a proper generalization of the undirected-case
problem so that our method can also be adopted for undirected social networks.
As a baseline for comparison in the undirected case, we develop a semidefinite

arises due to the scarcity of high-quality speech datasets with natural text

of this, 1) we propose TextrolSpeech, which is the first large-scale speech

forecasting. Previous researches mainly focus on training stage enhancement.
However, once the model is trained and deployed, it may need to `forget' (i.e.,
remove the impact of) part of training data if the data is found to be
malicious or as requested by the data owner. This paper introduces machine
unlearning algorithm which is specifically designed to remove the influence of
part of the original dataset on an already trained forecaster. However, direct
unlearning inevitably degrades the model generalization ability. To balance
between unlearning completeness and performance degradation, a
performance-aware algorithm is proposed by evaluating the sensitivity of local
model parameter change using influence function and sample re-weighting.
Moreover, we observe that the statistic criterion cannot fully reflect the
operation cost of down-stream tasks. Therefore, a task-aware machine unlearning
is proposed whose objective is a tri-level optimization with dispatch and
redispatch problems considered. We theoretically prove the existence of the
gradient of such objective, which is key to re-weighting the remaining samples.

graph structure information, we utilize positional encoding and make use of the
GNN layer to fuse the structure into node attributes, which improves the
Transformer in graph data. We also propose to sample the most relevant nodes

it is challenging to conduct a secrecy-oriented access strategy due to both
heterogeneous resources and different eavesdropping models. In this paper, we
explore secure access selection for a scenario involving multi-mode users
capable of accessing satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles, or base stations in
the presence of eavesdroppers. Particularly, we propose a Q-network

Self-supervised learning struggles to overcome the drawbacks of data scarcity,

adaptively learn Sobol indices for global sensitivity analysis. We demonstrate
that active learning for Sobol indices poses unique challenges due to the
definition of the Sobol index as a ratio of variances estimated from Gaussian

convergence in the numerator or the denominator of this ratio. However, rapid
convergence in either one does not guarantee convergence in the Sobol index. We
propose a novel strategy for active learning that focuses on resolving the main
effects of the Gaussian process (associated with the numerator of the Sobol
index) and compare this with existing strategies based on convergence in the
total variance (the denominator of the Sobol index). The new strategy,
implemented through a new learning function termed the MUSIC (minimize
uncertainty in Sobol index convergence), generally converges in Sobol index
error more rapidly than the existing strategies based on the Expected
Improvement for Global Fit (EIGF) and the Variance Improvement for Global Fit

excellent performance in generating sharp realistic images and VAEs have shown
strong abilities to generate diverse images. However, GANs suffer from ignoring
a large portion of the possible output space which does not represent the full
diversity of the target distribution, and VAEs tend to produce blurry images.
To fully capitalize on the strengths of both models while mitigating their

to explore areas of the code space that the VAE might have overlooked. With a
BNP perspective, we can model the data distribution using an

considering that changes like putrefaction and autolysis could significantly
change typical histopathological appearance. Developing AI-based computational
pathology techniques to assist forensic pathologists is practically meaningful,
which requires reliable discriminative representation learning to capture
tissues' fine-grained postmortem patterns. To this end, we propose a framework
called FPath, in which a dedicated self-supervised contrastive learning
strategy and a context-aware multiple-instance learning (MIL) block are
designed to learn discriminative representations from postmortem
histopathological images acquired at varying magnification scales. Our
self-supervised learning step leverages multiple complementary contrastive
losses and regularization terms to train a double-tier backbone for
fine-grained and informative patch/instance embedding. Thereafter, the
context-aware MIL adaptively distills from the local instances a holistic
bag/image-level representation for the recognition task. On a large-scale
database of $19,607$ experimental rat postmortem images and $3,378$ real-world
human decedent images, our FPath led to state-of-the-art accuracy and promising
cross-domain generalization in recognizing seven different postmortem tissues.

on the quality of the available channel state information (CSI) at the
transmitter and receiver. Several previous works have proposed concepts and
algorithms that help maintain high quality CSI even in the presence of high
mobility and channel aging, such as temporal prediction schemes that employ
neural networks. However, it is still unclear which neural network-based scheme
provides the best performance in terms of prediction quality, training
complexity and practical feasibility. To investigate such a question, this
paper first provides an overview of state-of-the-art neural networks applicable
to channel prediction and compares their performance in terms of prediction
quality. Next, a new comparative analysis is proposed for four promising neural
networks with different prediction horizons. The well-known tapped delay
channel model recommended by the Third Generation Partnership Program is used
for a standardized comparison among the neural networks. Based on this

and degradation rate for improved life prediction performance. The aging state
is indicated by six physical features of an equivalent circuit model that are
extracted from the voltage relaxation data. And the degradation rate is
captured by two features extracted from the differences between the voltage
relaxation curves within a moving window (for life prediction), or the
differences between the capacity vs. voltage curves at different cycles (for
life classification). Two machine learning models, which are constructed based
on Gaussian Processes, are used to describe the relationships between these
physical features and battery lifetimes for the life prediction and
classification, respectively. The methodology is validated with the aging data
of 74 battery cells of three different types. Experimental results show that
based on only 3-12 minutes' sampling data, the method with novel features
predicts accurate battery lifetimes, with the prediction accuracy improved by
up to 67.09% compared with the benchmark method. And the batteries are

large number of classes, we propose a novel approach called JLSPCADL. This
paper uses the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) Lemma to select the dimensionality of
a transformed space in which a discriminative dictionary can be learned for
signal classification. Rather than reducing dimensionality via random
projections, as is often done with JL, we use a projection transformation
matrix derived from Modified Supervised PC Analysis (M-SPCA) with the
JL-prescribed dimension.
  JLSPCADL provides a heuristic to deduce suitable distortion levels and the
corresponding Suitable Description Length (SDL) of dictionary atoms to derive
an optimal feature space and thus the SDL of dictionary atoms for better
classification. Unlike state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction-based
dictionary learning methods, a projection transformation matrix derived in a
single step from M-SPCA provides maximum feature-label consistency of the
transformed space while preserving the cluster structure of the original data.
Despite confusing pairs, the dictionary for the transformed space generates
discriminative sparse coefficients, with fewer training samples.
Experimentation demonstrates that JLSPCADL scales well with an increasing
number of classes and dimensionality. Improved label consistency of features
due to M-SPCA helps to classify better. Further, the complexity of training a
discriminative dictionary is significantly reduced by using SDL.
Experimentation on OCR and face recognition datasets shows relatively better
classification performance than other supervised dictionary learning
algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.13991v1

discontinuities of both input functions and output solutions across the
interface, IONet divides the entire domain into several separate sub-domains
according to the interface, and leverages multiple branch networks and truck
networks. Each branch network extracts latent representations of input
functions at a fixed number of sensors on a specific sub-domain, and each truck
network is responsible for output solutions on one sub-domain. In addition,
tailored physics-informed loss of IONet is proposed to ensure physical
consistency, which greatly reduces the requirement for training datasets and
makes IONet effective without any paired input-output observations in the
interior of the computational domain. Extensive numerical studies show that
IONet outperforms existing state-of-the-art deep operator networks in terms of

oversampling, with collocation points inside the domain only, resulting in a
rectangular linear system to be solved in a least squares sense. The goal of
this paper is the efficient solution of that rectangular system. We show that
the least squares problem splits into a regular part, which can be expedited
with the FFT, and a low rank perturbation, which is treated separately with a
direct solver. The rank of the perturbation is influenced by the irregular
shape of the domain and by the weak enforcement of boundary conditions at
points along the boundary. The solver extends the AZ algorithm which was

shock waves. Shock waves feature jump discontinuities in the velocity and
density of the fluid and thus preclude the existence of classical solutions to
the compressible Euler equations. Weak ""entropy"" solutions are commonly defined
by viscous regularization, but even small amounts of viscosity can
substantially change the long-term behavior of the solution. In this work, we
propose an inviscid regularization based on ideas from semidefinite programming
and information geometry. From a Lagrangian perspective, shock formation in
entropy solutions amounts to inelastic collisions of fluid particles. Their
trajectories are akin to that of projected gradient descent on a feasible set
of nonintersecting paths. We regularize these trajectories by replacing them
with solution paths of interior point methods based on log determinantal
barrier functions. These paths are geodesic curves with respect to the
information geometry induced by the barrier function. Thus, our regularization
amounts to replacing the Euclidean geometry of phase space with a suitable
information geometry. We extend this idea to infinite families of paths by
viewing Euler's equations as a dynamical system on a diffeomorphism manifold.
Our regularization embeds this manifold into an information geometric ambient
space, equipping it with a geodesically complete geometry. Expressing the
resulting Lagrangian equations in Eulerian form, we derive a regularized Euler
equation in conservation form. Numerical experiments on one and two-dimensional

compressive sensing approach may be used to produce a low-rank factorization of
a huge tensor that is too large to store in memory with a total memory

addition, the compressive sensing recovery algorithm itself (which takes the
compressive measurements as input, and then outputs a low-rank factorization)

Network (OL-GAN) is proposed and integrated into the Bayesian inference
framework to handle these issues. Unlike most Bayesian approaches, the
distinctive characteristic of the proposed method is to learn the joint

model, the posteriors of the unknown parameters can theoretically be
approximated by any sampling algorithm (e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo, MCMC)
in a low-dimensional latent space shared by the components of the joint
distribution. The latent space is typically a simple and easy-to-sample
distribution (e.g., Gaussian, uniform), which significantly reduces the

resolution-independent in the generator. Predictions can be obtained at desired

of equations. We study a nonclassic matrix condition number, the
$\omega$-condition number, in the context of optimal conditioning for low rank
updating of positive definite matrices. For a positive definite matrix, this
condition measure is the ratio of the arithmetic and geometric means of the
eigenvalues. In particular, we concentrate on linear systems with low rank
updates of positive definite matrices which are close to singular. These
systems arise in the contexts of nonsmooth Newton methods using generalized
Jacobians. We derive an explicit formula for the optimal
$\omega$-preconditioned update in this framework.
  Evaluating or estimating the classical condition number $\kappa$ can be
expensive. We show that the $\omega$-condition number can be evaluated exactly
following a Cholesky or LU factorization and it estimates the actual condition
of a linear system significantly better. Moreover, our empirical results show a
significant decrease in the number of iterations required for a requested

a fully diagonalizable auxiliary problem, which is derived from the spectral

Pore-scale modeling of reactive flow offers a valuable opportunity to
investigate the evolution of macro-scale properties subject to dynamic
processes. Yet, they suffer from imaging limitations arising from the
associated X-ray microtomography (X-ray microCT) process, which induces
discrepancies in the properties estimates. Assessment of the kinetic parameters
also raises challenges, as reactive coefficients are critical parameters that
can cover a wide range of values. We account for these two issues and ensure
reliable calibration of pore-scale modeling, based on dynamical microCT images,
by integrating uncertainty quantification in the workflow.
  The present method is based on a multitasking formulation of reactive inverse
problems combining data-driven and physics-informed techniques in calcite
dissolution. This allows quantifying morphological uncertainties on the
porosity field and estimating reactive parameter ranges through prescribed PDE
models with a latent concentration field and dynamical microCT. The data
assimilation strategy relies on sequential reinforcement incorporating
successively additional PDE constraints. We guarantee robust and unbiased
uncertainty quantification by straightforward adaptive weighting of Bayesian
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINNs), ensuring reliable micro-porosity

certain objective function over the Riemannian manifold $SU(n) \times SU(n)$,
where $SU(n)$ denotes the special unitary group. With minor modifications, the

with an algorithm capable of doing optimization on a Riemannian manifold. We
provide numerical experiments that show that the resulting method allows us to
deal with pencils of much larger size than alternative techniques, yielding
candidate minimizers of comparable or better quality. In the course of our

that hold together solely through contact. Such structures have been shown to
exhibit high strength, energy dissipation, and crack arrest properties. Recent
studies on beam-like topologically interlocked structures have shown that, with
non-planar blocks, it is possible to reach levels of strength and
work-to-failure which are otherwise possible only with unrealistically high
friction coefficients. While non-planar blocks have been extensively used for
slab-like assemblies, many questions in that context are still not fully
understood. Specifically, it is unclear what are the exact characteristics of
non-planar surface morphologies which can potentially improve the enhanced
mechanical response of slab-like assemblies. In addition, it is unclear if
slab-like structures with non-planar surface blocks can reach a saturated
response with realistic friction coefficient values, as is the case with
beam-like ones. Here, we investigate such fundamental questions using numerical
simulations. We show that, by using non-planar blocks, it is possible to reach
saturation to the response capacity of the structure with a realistic friction
coefficient. Furthermore, we show that the key morphology parameter responsible
for the enhanced performance is the local angle of inclination at the top of
the loaded block. Lastly, we show that non-planar morphologies lead to improved
work-to-failure and ultimate deflection, which cannot be attained with
planar-faced blocks. These findings shed new light on topologically interlocked

Introducing adversarial examples during training has been shown to reduce the
susceptibility of NNs to adversarial attack; however, it has also been shown to
reduce the accuracy of the classifier if the examples are not valid examples

Constrained Pressure Residual (CPR) physics-based block-preconditioner is known
to perform rather poorly or fail to converge when thermal effects play a
significant role. The Constrained Pressure-Temperature Residual (CPTR)
preconditioner retains the 2x2 block structure (elliptic/hyperbolic) of CPR but
includes the temperature in the elliptic subsystem. The elliptic subsystem is
now formed by two equations, and is dealt with by the system-solver of
BoomerAMG (from the HYPRE library). Then a global smoother, ILU(0), is applied
to the full system to handle the local, hyperbolic temperature fronts. We
implemented CPTR in the multi-physics solver GEOS and present results on
various large-scale thermal CCS simulation cases, including both Cartesian and
fully unstructured meshes, up to tens of millions of degrees of freedom. The
CPTR preconditioner severely reduces the number of GMRES iterations and the
runtime, with cases timing out in 24h with CPR now requiring a few hours with
CPTR. We present strong scaling results using hundreds of CPU cores for
multiple cases, and show close to linear scaling. CPTR is also virtually
insensitive to the thermal Peclet number (which compares advection and
diffusion effects) and is suitable to any thermal regime.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11892v1

multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann (GPMRT-LB) model and obtain the
corresponding macroscopic finite-difference (GPMFD) scheme on conservative
moments. Then based on the Maxwell iteration method, we conduct the analysis on
the truncation errors and modified equations (MEs) of the GPMRT-LB model and
GPMFD scheme at both diffusive and acoustic scalings. For the nonlinear
anisotropic convection-diffusion equation (NACDE) and Navier-Stokes equations
(NSEs), we also derive the first- and second-order MEs of the GPMRT-LB model
and GPMFD scheme. In particular, for the one-dimensional convection-diffusion
equation (CDE) with the constant velocity and diffusion coefficient, we can
develop a fourth-order GPMRT-LB (F-GPMRT-LB) model and the corresponding
fourth-order GPMFD (F-GPMFD) scheme at the diffusive scaling. Finally, two
benchmark problems, Gauss hill problem and Poiseuille flow in two-dimensional
space, are used to test the GPMRT-LB model and GPMFD scheme, and it is found
that the numerical results are not only in good agreement with corresponding
analytical solutions, but also have a second-order convergence rate in space.
Additionally, a numerical study on one-dimensional CDE also demonstrates that
the F-GPMRT-LB model and F-GPMFD scheme can achieve a fourth-order accuracy in

contrast with the standard incremental approach, which solves the (non-linear

the proposed PGD approach allows the mechanical balance equations to be solved
exclusively for the small-time intra-cyclic response, while the large-time
inter-cyclic response is described by simple scalar algebraic equations.

the peculiarity that both the basis vectors and the random coefficients vary in
time. While the formulation and properties of DLRA are now well understood for
random/parametric equations, the same cannot be said for SDEs and this work
aims to fill this gap. We start by rigorously formulating a Dynamically
Orthogonal (DO) approximation (an instance of DLRA successfully used in
applications) for SDEs, which we then generalize to define a parametrization
independent DLRA for SDEs. We show local well-posedness of the DO equations and
their equivalence with the DLRA formulation. We also characterize the explosion

has shown promising results for several classes of initial and boundary-value
problems. However, their ability to surpass, particularly in terms of accuracy,
classical discretization methods such as the finite element methods, remains a
significant challenge. Deep learning methods usually struggle to reliably
decrease the error in their approximate solution. A new methodology to better
control the error for deep learning methods is presented here. The main idea
consists in computing an initial approximation to the problem using a simple
neural network and in estimating, in an iterative manner, a correction by
solving the problem for the residual error with a new network of increasing
complexity. This sequential reduction of the residual of the partial
differential equation allows one to decrease the solution error, which, in some
cases, can be reduced to machine precision. The underlying explanation is that
the method is able to capture at each level smaller scales of the solution
using a new network. Numerical examples in 1D and 2D are presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This approach applies

R},u(\cdot),f(\cdot)\in{\mathbb C}$) is a mainstay of computational wave
simulation. Despite its apparent simplicity, efficient numerical methods are
challenging to design and, in some applications, regarded as an open problem.
Two sources of difficulty are the large number of degrees of freedom and the
indefiniteness of the matrices arising after discretisation. Seeking to meet
them within the novel framework of probabilistic domain decomposition, we set
out to rewrite the Helmholtz equation into a form amenable to the Feynman-Kac
formula for elliptic boundary value problems. We consider two typical
scenarios, the scattering of a plane wave and the propagation inside a cavity,
and recast them as a sequence of Poisson equations. By means of stochastic
arguments, we find a sufficient and simulatable condition for the convergence
of the iterations. Upon discretisation a necessary condition for convergence
can be derived by adding up the iterates using the harmonic series for the
matrix inverse -- we illustrate the procedure in the case of finite
differences.
  From a practical point of view, our results are ultimately of limited scope.
Nonetheless, this unexpected -- even paradoxical -- new direction of attack on
the Helmholtz equation proposed by this work offers a fresh perspective on this
classical and difficult problem. Our results show that there indeed exists a

many others, excellent stiffness-to-weight ratios. We develop here a dedicated
HPC solver that benefits from the specific nature of the underlying problem in
order to drastically reduce the computational costs (memory and time) for the
full fine-scale analysis of lattice structures. Our purpose is to take
advantage of the natural domain decomposition into cells and, even more
importantly, of the geometrical and mechanical similarities among cells. Our
solver consists in a so-called inexact FETI-DP method where the local,
cell-wise operators and solutions are approximated with reduced order modeling
techniques. Instead of considering independently every cell, we end up with
only few principal local problems to solve and make use of the corresponding
principal cell-wise operators to approximate all the others. It results in a
scalable algorithm that saves numerous local factorizations. Our solver is
applied for the isogeometric analysis of lattices built by spline composition,
which offers the opportunity to compute the reduced basis with macro-scale
data, thereby making our method also multiscale and matrix-free. The solver is

second-order elliptic problems have to be solved, and a normal derivative on
the boundary has to be computed. In this work, we specialize this scheme for
the HHO discretization. To this aim, an explicit technique to compute the
discrete normal derivative of an HHO solution of a Laplacian problem is
proposed. Moreover, we show that the resulting discrete scheme is well-posed.

of the parameters that define the function, called training, is done via the
resolution of the approximation problem, so by imposing the interpolation
through a set of specific nodes. We present the case where the parameters are
trained using a procedure that is referred to as Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)
that leads to a linear interpolation problem. In such hypotheses, the existence
of an ANN interpolating function is guaranteed. The focus is then on the
accuracy of the interpolation outside of the given sampling interpolation nodes
when they are the equispaced, the Chebychev, and the randomly selected ones.
The study is motivated by the well-known bell-shaped Runge example, which makes
it clear that the construction of a global interpolating polynomial is accurate
only if trained on suitably chosen nodes, ad example the Chebychev ones. In
order to evaluate the behavior when growing the number of interpolation nodes,
we raise the number of neurons in our network and compare it with the
interpolating polynomial. We test using Runge's function and other well-known
examples with different regularities. As expected, the accuracy of the
approximation with a global polynomial increases only if the Chebychev nodes
are considered. Instead, the error for the ANN interpolating function always
decays and in most cases we observe that the convergence follows what is
observed in the polynomial case on Chebychev nodes, despite the set of nodes

spectral information of crucial interest. Numerous algorithms have been
developed to approximate these spectral properties, and Dynamic Mode
Decomposition (DMD) stands out as the poster child of projection-based methods.
Although the Koopman operator itself is linear, the fact that it acts in an
infinite-dimensional space of observables poses various challenges. These
include spurious modes, essential spectra, and the verification of Koopman mode
decompositions. While recent work has addressed these challenges for
deterministic systems, there remains a notable gap in verified DMD methods
tailored for stochastic systems, where the Koopman operator measures the
expectation of observables. We show that it is necessary to go beyond
expectations to address these issues. By incorporating variance into the
Koopman framework, we address these challenges. Through an additional DMD-type
matrix, we approximate the sum of a squared residual and a variance term, each
of which can be approximated individually using batched snapshot data. This
allows verified computation of the spectral properties of stochastic Koopman
operators, controlling the projection error. We also introduce the concept of

operator-valued Riccati equations posed on Hilbert spaces. It is demonstrated
here, under the assumption of compactness in the coefficient operators, that
the error of the approximate solution to the operator-valued Riccati equation
is bounded above by the approximation error of the governing semigroup. One
significant outcome of this result is the correct prediction of optimal
convergence for finite element approximations of the operator-valued Riccati
equations for when the governing semigroup involves parabolic, as well as
hyperbolic processes. We derive the abstract theory for the time-dependent and
time-independent operator-valued Riccati equations in the first part of this
work. In the second part, we prove optimal convergence rates for the finite
element approximation of the functional gain associated with model
one-dimensional weakly damped wave and thermal LQR control systems. These
theoretical claims are then corroborated with computational evidence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10130v1

defined for all physically relevant moments and the resultant approximations of
the distribution function converge as the number of moments goes to infinity.
The convergence makes our method stand out from most existing moment methods.
Moreover, we devise a delicate moment inversion algorithm. As an application,
the Vicsek model is studied for overdamped active particles. Then the

distributions is of essential importance in many application areas and has been
an active research area for decades. One approach that has drawn increasing
attention in recent years has been the generation of samples from a target
distribution $\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{tar}}$ using transport maps: if
$\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{tar}} = T_\# \mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{ref}}$ is the pushforward
of an easily-sampled probability distribution $\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{ref}}$ under
the transport map $T$, then the application of $T$ to
$\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{ref}}$-distributed samples yields
$\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{tar}}$-distributed samples. This paper proposes the
application of transport maps not just to random samples, but also to
quasi-Monte Carlo points, higher-order nets, and sparse grids in order for the
transformed samples to inherit the original convergence rates that are often
better than $N^{-1/2}$, $N$ being the number of samples/quadrature nodes. Our
main result is the derivation of an explicit transport map for the case that
$\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{tar}}$ is a mixture of simple distributions, e.g.\ a
Gaussian mixture, in which case application of the transport map $T$ requires
the solution of an \emph{explicit} ODE with \emph{closed-form} right-hand side.
Mixture distributions are of particular applicability and interest since many
methods proceed by first approximating $\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{tar}}$ by a mixture
and then sampling from that mixture (often using importance reweighting).
Hence, this paper allows for the sampling step to provide a better convergence
rate than $N^{-1/2}$ for all such methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10081v1

observation is that the convergence rates of both one- and two-level additive
Schwarz methods have bounds independent of the nonlinear term in the problem.
That is, the convergence rates do not deteriorate by the presence of
nonlinearity, so that solving a semilinear problem requires no more iterations
than a linear problem. Moreover, the two-level method is scalable in the sense
that the convergence rate of the method depends on $H/h$ and $H/\delta$ only,

integro-differential equations with memory terms where the time derivative of a
state variable at a given time depends on all past states of the system.
Secondly, there are equations whose solutions do not have well-defined Taylor
series expansion. The Maxey-Riley-Gatignol equation, which describes the
dynamics of an inertial particle in nonuniform and unsteady flow, displays both
challenges. We use it as a test bed to address the questions we raise, but our
method may be applied to all equations of this class. We show that the
Maxey-Riley-Gatignol equation can be embedded into an extended Markovian system

that encodes memory of past states. We develop a Runge-Kutta algorithm for the
resultant Markovian system. The form of the kernels involved in deriving the
Runge-Kutta scheme necessitates the use of an expansion in powers of $t^{1/2}$.
Our approach naturally inherits the benefits of standard time-integrators,

focus on the average inverse geodesic length, which we refer to as the
multiplex global efficiency $e_\mathcal{A}(\gamma)$ by means of the multiplex

interpretations. For models that are smooth or regularised by Moreau-Yosida
smoothing, the algorithm is equivalent to an implicit midpoint discretisation
of an overdamped Langevin diffusion targeting the posterior distribution of
interest. This discretisation is asymptotically unbiased for Gaussian targets
and shown to converge in an accelerated manner for any target that is
$\kappa$-strongly log-concave (i.e., requiring in the order of $\sqrt{\kappa}$
iterations to converge, similarly to accelerated optimisation schemes),
comparing favorably to [M. Pereyra, L. Vargas Mieles, K.C. Zygalakis, SIAM J.

for Gaussian targets and has bias. For models that are not smooth, the
algorithm is equivalent to a Leimkuhler-Matthews discretisation of a Langevin
diffusion targeting a Moreau-Yosida approximation of the posterior distribution
of interest, and hence achieves a significantly lower bias than conventional
unadjusted Langevin strategies based on the Euler-Maruyama discretisation. For
targets that are $\kappa$-strongly log-concave, the provided non-asymptotic

schemes, the numerical solution of the momentum will form a spurious spike at
the discontinuous points of the bottom, which should not exist in the exact
solution. The height of the spike cannot be reduced even after the mesh is
refined. For subsonic problems, this numerical artifact may cause the wrong
convergence to a function far away from the exact solution. To explain the
formation of the spurious spike, we perform a convergence analysis by proving a
Lax--Wendroff type theorem. It is shown that the spurious spike is caused by
the numerical viscosity in the computation of the water height at the
discontinuous bottom. The height of the spike is proportional to the magnitude
of the viscosity constant in the Lax--Friedrichs flux. Motivated by this
conclusion, we propose a modified scheme by adopting the central flux at the
bottom discontinuity in the equation of mass conservation, and show that this

  This article presents two new PML formulations for arbitrary poroelastic
domains. The first formulation is a fully-mixed form that employs time-history
variables instead of ADEs, reducing the number of unknowns and mathematical
operations. The second formulation is a hybrid form that restricts the
fully-mixed formulation to the PML domain, resulting in smaller matrices for

static correlations for closed-shell molecular systems
[\href{https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c00730}{\textit{J.~Phys.~Chem.~Lett.}~\textbf{2022},
\textit{13}, 4342}]. Here, we generalize hCI for an arbitrary reference
determinant, allowing calculations for radicals and for excited states in a
state-specific way. We gauge this route against excitation-based CI (eCI) and
seniority-based CI (sCI) by evaluating how different ground-state properties of
radicals converge to the full CI limit. We find that hCI outperforms or matches
eCI, whereas sCI is far less accurate, in line with previous observations for
closed-shell molecules. Employing the second-order Epstein-Nesbet perturbation
theory as a correction significantly accelerates the convergence of hCI and
eCI. We further explore various hCI and sCI models to calculate excitation
energies of closed- and open-shell systems. Our results underline that both the
choice of the reference determinant and the set of orbitals drive the fine
balance between correlation of ground and excited states. State-specific hCI2
and higher order models perform similarly to their eCI counterparts, whereas
lower orders of hCI deliver poor results. In turn, sCI1 produces decent
excitation energies for radicals, encouraging the development of related
seniority-based coupled cluster methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14618v1

Decomposition (DMD) algorithm based on variable projection optimization, called
Optimized DMD (OPT-DMD), enables a robust identification of the dominant
spatiotemporally coherent modes underlying the data across various test cases
representing different physical parameters in an ExB simulation configuration.
As the OPT-DMD can be constrained to produce stable reduced-order models (ROMs)
by construction, in this paper, we extend the application of the OPT-DMD and
investigate the capabilities of the linear ROM from this algorithm toward
forecasting in time of the plasma dynamics in configurations representative of
the radial-azimuthal and axial-azimuthal cross-sections of a Hall thruster and
over a range of simulation parameters in each test case. The predictive
capacity of the OPT-DMD ROM is assessed primarily in terms of short-term
dynamics forecast or, in other words, for large ratios of training-to-test
data. However, the utility of the ROM for long-term dynamics forecasting is
also presented for an example case in the radial-azimuthal configuration. The
model's predictive performance is heterogeneous across various test cases.
Nonetheless, a remarkable predictiveness is observed in the test cases that do
not exhibit highly transient behaviors. Moreover, in all investigated cases,
the error between the ground-truth and the reconstructed data from the OPT-DMD
ROM remains bounded over time within both the training and the test window. As
a result, despite its limitation in terms of generalized applicability to all
plasma conditions, the OPT-DMD is proven as a reliable method to develop low

reduced-order modelling of plasma dynamics in cross-field ExB configurations.
The DMD algorithm is an interpretable data-driven method that finds a best-fit
linear model describing the time evolution of spatiotemporally coherent
structures (patterns) in data. We have applied the DMD to extensive
high-fidelity datasets generated using a particle-in-cell (PIC) code based on a
cost-efficient reduced-order PIC scheme. In this part, we first provide an
overview of the concept of DMD and its underpinning Proper Orthogonal and
Singular Value Decomposition methods. Two of the main DMD variants are next
introduced. We then present and discuss the results of the DMD application in
terms of the identification and extraction of the dominant spatiotemporal modes
from high-fidelity data over a range of simulation conditions. We demonstrate
that the DMD variant based on variable projection optimization (OPT-DMD)
outperforms the basic DMD method in identification of the modes underlying the
data, leading to notably more reliable reconstruction of the ground-truth.
Furthermore, we show in multiple test cases that the discrete frequency
spectrum of OPT-DMD-extracted modes is consistent with the temporal spectrum
from the Fast Fourier Transform of the data. This observation implies that the
OPT-DMD augments the conventional spectral analyses by being able to uniquely
reveal the spatial structure of the dominant modes in the frequency spectra,

However, the standard coupling architecture precludes endowing flows that
operate on the Cartesian coordinates of atoms with the SE(3) and permutation

preserves SE(3) and permutation equivariance by performing coordinate splits
along additional augmented dimensions. At each layer, the flow maps atoms'
positions into learned SE(3) invariant bases, where we apply standard flow
transformations, such as monotonic rational-quadratic splines, before returning
to the original basis. Crucially, our flow preserves fast sampling and density
evaluation, and may be used to produce unbiased estimates of expectations with
respect to the target distribution via importance sampling. When trained on the
DW4, LJ13 and QM9-positional datasets, our flow is competitive with equivariant
continuous normalizing flows, while allowing sampling two orders of magnitude
faster. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to learn the
full Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide by only modeling the Cartesian

strong shock wave propagating over the surface of a dense layer of particles

The setting of the problem follows the full-scale experiment. The mathematical
model is based on a two-dimensional system of Baer-Nunziato equations and takes
into account intergranular stresses arising in the solid phase of particles.
The computational algorithm is based on the HLLC method with a pressure
relaxation procedure. The developed algorithm proved to be efficient for
two-phase problems with explicit interfacial boundaries and strong shock waves.
These issues are typical of problems arising from the interaction of a shock
wave with a bed or a layer of particles. A comparison with the simulations and
full-scale experiments of other authors is carried out. A reasonable agreement
with the experiment is obtained for the angles of the transmitted compaction
wave and granular contact, including their dependency on the intensity of the

shock wave Mach number, while the transmitted compaction wave angle decreases.
The explanation of the phenomenon of the decrease in thickness of the compacted

water nanoconfined by graphene at ambient and extreme pressure-temperature

Raman stretching and low-frequency bands due to the graphene confinement. We
also found spectroscopic evidence indicating that nanoconfinement considerably
changes the tetrahedral hydrogen bond network, which is typically found in bulk

A multi-GPU convolution algorithm is developed here, which relies on single-GPU

the effect of biaxial strains on the electronic structures of 2D Rashba
MoSiGeN4 (MSGN), and further explore how the interlayer interactions affect the
Rashba spin splitting in such strained layered MSGNs. After applying biaxial
strains, the band gap decreases monotonically with increasing tensile strains
but increases when the compressive strains are applied. An
indirect-direct-indirect band gap transition is induced by applying a moderate
compressive strain (< 5%) in the MSGNs. Due to the symmetry breaking and
moderate spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the monolayer MSGN possess an isolated
Rashba spin splitting (R) near the Fermi level, which could be effectively
regulated to the Lifshitz transition (L) by biaxial strain. For instance, a
L-R-L transformation of Fermi surface is presented in monolayer and a more
complex and changeable L-R-L-R evolution is observed in bilayer and trilayer
MSGNs as the biaxial strain vary from -8% to 12%, which actually depend on the
appearance, variation, and vanish of the Mexican hat band in the absence of SOC
under different strains. The contribution of Mo-dz2 orbital hybridized with
N-pz orbital in the highest valence band plays a dominant role on the band

three correlated magnetic systems, Na$_2$BaX(PO$_4$)$_2$ (X = Mn, Co, Ni), and
revealed their unusual electronic structure and magnetic properties. Despite
their different effective angular momentum, our first-principles calculations
showed a similar electronic structure among them. However, their different
valence configurations led to different responses to electronic correlations in
the high-temperature paramagnetic phase. Using the dynamical mean-field method,
we found that all systems can be understood as a multi-band Hubbard model with
Hund'ss coupling. Our calculations of spin susceptibility and the {\it
ab-initio} estimation of magnetic exchange coupling indicated strong
intra-plane antiferromagnetic coupling and weak inter-plane coupling in all
systems. The ground states of these systems are largely degenerate. It is
likely that none of these magnetic states would dominate over the others,
leading to the possibility of quantum spin liquid states in these systems. Our

An AMR scheme that could manage a computational mesh entirely on the GPU

substantial speedup to GPU-accelerated solvers, however, implementations
commonly employ CPU/hybrid frameworks instead, due to lack of a recursive data

meshing code is equipped with a Lattice Boltzmann solver for assessing
performance. Different AMR approaches and consequences in implementation are
considered before careful selection of data structures enabling efficient
refinement and coarsening compatible with single instruction multiple data
architecture is detailed. Inter-level communication is achieved by tricubic
interpolation and standard spatial averaging. Although the present open-source

estimate the self-similar solutions to the equations of motion in the
hyperbolic class in four dimensions. Due to the complex and highly nonlinear
patterns, researchers typically have to use various constraints and numerical
approximation methods to estimate the equations of motion; thus, they have to

propose the SMC approach to obtain the multi-modal posterior distributions.
Through a probabilistic perspective, we confirm the deterministic $\alpha$ and

simulations of fictitious systems which contain an interpolating continuous
variable $\xi\in[-1,1]$ in their partition function, with the physical Fermi-

It has been proposed that thermodynamic information about the fermionic limit

accuracy and speed of scientific computing tasks using machine learning
methods. Traditional AI benchmarking methods struggle to adapt to the unique
challenges posed by AI4S because they assume data in training, testing, and
future real-world queries are independent and identically distributed, while
AI4S workloads anticipate out-of-distribution problem instances. This paper
investigates the need for a novel approach to effectively benchmark AI for
science, using the machine learning force field (MLFF) as a case study. MLFF is
a method to accelerate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with low
computational cost and high accuracy. We identify various missed opportunities
in scientifically meaningful benchmarking and propose solutions to evaluate
MLFF models, specifically in the aspects of sample efficiency, time domain
sensitivity, and cross-dataset generalization capabilities. By setting up the
problem instantiation similar to the actual scientific applications, more
meaningful performance metrics from the benchmark can be achieved. This suite
of metrics has demonstrated a better ability to assess a model's performance in
real-world scientific applications, in contrast to traditional AI benchmarking
methodologies. This work is a component of the SAIBench project, an AI4S

Boltzmann equation have evolved to the cornerstone of non-equilibrium gas

that long-range interactions arising from the attractive tail of molecular
potentials, lead to a computationally demanding Vlasov integral. This study
focuses on numerical remedies for efficient stochastic particle simulations
based on the Enskog-Vlasov kinetic equation. In particular, we devise a
Poisson-type elliptic equation that governs the underlying long-range
interactions. The idea comes through fitting a Green function to the molecular
potential, and hence deriving an elliptic equation for the associated
fundamental solution. Through this transformation of the Vlasov integral,
efficient Poisson-type solvers can be readily employed in order to compute the
mean field forces. Besides the technical aspects of different numerical schemes

By contrast, AlSc possesses a significantly superior ductility evaluated from
all Pugh's, Pettifor's and Poisson's ductility-brittleness criteria. At ground
state, AlSc meets the criteria of ductile according to Pugh's and Poisson's
theories, while it is categorized as the brittle in the frame of Pettifor's
picture. With the increasing temperature, the ductility of all the studied
compounds exhibits a noticeable improvement. In particular, as the temperature
rises, the Cauchy pressure of AlSc undergoes a transition from negative to
positive. Thus, at high temperatures (T > 600 K), AlSc is unequivocally
classified as the ductile from all criteria considered. In all Al$_3$Sc,
Al$_2$Sc and AlSc, the Al-Al bond, originated from s-p and p-p orbital
hybridizations, and the Al-Sc bond, dominated by p-d covalent hybridization,
are the first and second strongest chemical bonds, respectively. To explain the
difference in mechanical properties of the studied compounds, the mean bond
strength (MBS) is evaluated. The weaker Al-Al bond in AlSc, leading to a
smaller MBS, could be the origin for the softer elastic stiffness and superior
intrinsic ductility. The longer length of the Al-Al bond in AlSc is responsible

functional theory, we demonstrate that the energy barrier varies significantly
depending on the molecular position on the surface, creating ""hot spots"" for
possible carrier injection. These areas arise due to an intertwined competition
between purely plasmonic couplings (charge density fluctuations on the
substrate surface alone) and the degree of hybridization between the molecule
and the substrate. There are multiple positions found with the lowest energy
barrier for the electron/hole injection. We identify that the charge injection
barrier to the adsorbate on the plasmonic surface trends down from the facet
edge to the facet center -- here, the change in molecular orbitals overshadows

transition is discerned at the Cr$_{0.5}$S composition, characterized by a
preferential migration of half of the Cr atoms to the van der Waals (vdW) gaps.
This highlights the experimentally observed non-vdW nature of CrS$_2$ and
emphasizes the pivotal role of excess Cr atoms beyond the composition ratio of
Cr/S = $1/2$ in stabilizing the vdW gaps. Additionally, we employ the NNP model
in a large-scale vacancy diffusion Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to emphasize the

we show how large GPU-based supercomputers can be used to assess the
performance of Shor's algorithm for numbers that are out of reach for current

which the success probability can be brought arbitrarily close to one, with
only a single run of Shor's quantum algorithm. Finally, we study the
effectiveness of this post-processing procedure in the presence of typical

algorithm exhibits a particular form of universality and resilience against the
different types of errors. The largest semiprime that we have factored by

This unmixing process requires that mixing preserves the identity of the

inference approach that explicitly incorporates noise and uncertainty, enabling
us to unmix endmembers in collections of mixtures with limited diversity. We

interaction with the environment can cause the emitters to undergo quantum
jumps between on and off states that correlate with higher and lower
photoemission events, respectively. Understanding and quantifying the mechanism
and dynamics of photoblinking is important for both fundamental and practical
reasons. However, the analysis of blinking time traces is often afflicted by
data scarcity. Blinking emitters can photo-bleach and cease to fluoresce over
time scales that are too short for their photodynamics to be captured by
traditional statistical methods. Here, we demonstrate two approaches based on
machine learning that directly address this problem. We present a multi-feature

fluctuations. Moreover, diabetes for a long duration usually becomes a critical
issue. In such situation, patients need to consult diabetologist frequently,
which is not possible in normal life. Therefore, it is required to develop
non-invasive glucose balancing paradigm, which measures blood glucose without
pricking blood along with physiological parameters measurement and decision
model. The proposed paradigm helps to doctor, who is even available at remote

randomness, mixing, dispersion, and number of microstates. However, there
remains ambiguity over the precise mathematical formulation of entropy,
generalized beyond the additive definition pioneered by Boltzmann, Gibbs, and
Shannon (applicable to thermodynamic equilibria). For generalized entropies to
be applied rigorously to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, we suggest that
there is a need for a physically interpretable (dimensional) framework that can
be connected to dynamical processes operating in phase space. In this work, we
introduce dimensional measures of entropy that admit arbitrary invertible
weight functions (subject to curvature and convergence requirements). These
""dimensional entropies"" have physical dimensions of phase-space volume and
represent the extent of level sets of the distribution function. Dimensional
entropies with power-law weight functions (related to R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis
entropies) are particularly robust, as they do not require any internal
dimensional parameters due to their scale invariance. We also point out the
existence of composite entropy measures that can be constructed from
functionals of dimensional entropies. We calculate the response of the
dimensional entropies to perturbations, showing that for a structured
distribution, perturbations have the largest impact on entropies weighted at a
similar phase-space scale. This elucidates the link between dynamics
(perturbations) and statistics (entropies). Finally, we derive corresponding
generalized maximum-entropy distributions. Dimensional entropies may be useful
as a diagnostic (for irreversibility) and for theoretical modeling (if the

dynamic changes in the subsurface by performing multiple seismic surveys at
different times. Since FWI problems are highly non-linear and non-unique, it is
important to quantify uncertainties in such estimates to allow robust decision
making. Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) methods have been used for this
purpose, but due to their high computational cost, those studies often require
an accurate baseline model and estimates of the locations of potential velocity
changes, and neglect uncertainty in the baseline velocity model. Such detailed
and accurate prior information is not always available in practice.
  In this study we use an efficient optimization method called stochastic Stein
variational gradient descent (sSVGD) to solve time-lapse FWI problems without
assuming such prior knowledge, and to estimate uncertainty both in the baseline
velocity model and the velocity change. We test two Bayesian strategies:
separate Bayesian inversions for each seismic survey, and a single join
inversion for baseline and repeat surveys, and compare the methods with the
standard linearised double difference inversion. The results demonstrate that
all three methods can produce accurate velocity change estimates in the case of
having fixed (exactly repeatable) acquisition geometries, but that the two
Bayesian methods generate more accurate results when the acquisition geometry
changes between surveys. Furthermore the joint inversion provides the most
accurate velocity change and uncertainty estimates in all cases. We therefore
conclude that Bayesian time-lapse inversion, especially adopting a joint
inversion strategy, may be useful to image and monitor the subsurface changes,
in particular where uncertainty in the results might lead to significantly

squared displacements, validated through simulations of Langevin equations. Our
model shows that the trapping mechanism attenuates the impact of media
heterogeneity. Superdiffusion occurs when the position-dependent coefficient
increases superlinearly, while subdiffusion occurs for sublinear and inverse
power-law relations. This nontrivial interplay between heterogeneity and
state-independent mechanisms also leads to anomalous yet Brownian and

separation goes to zero, and is proportional to the variance of the second
derivative of the electromagnetic field profile. Nevertheless, robust
subwavelength estimation is possible. Several different band-limited function

reveals previously unreported high-order modes of irreversibility, and
establishes a formal connection between recent heuristic markers of temporal
irreversibility and metrics of information processing. We demonstrate the
prevalence of high-order irreversibility in the hyperactive regime of a

twofold objective to improve the efficiency of global optimization algorithms
while promoting the generation of high-quality designs during the optimization
process free of geometrical anomalies. This is accomplished by reducing the
number of the original design variables defining a new reduced subspace where
the geometrical variance is maximized and modeling the underlying generative
process of the data via probabilistic linear latent variable models such as
Factor Analysis and Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis. We show that
the data follows approximately a Gaussian distribution when the shape
modification method is linear and the design variables are sampled uniformly at
random, due to the direct application of the central limit theorem. The model
uncertainty is measured in terms of Mahalanobis distance, and the paper
demonstrates that anomalous designs tend to exhibit a high value of this
metric. This enables the definition of a new optimization model where anomalous
geometries are penalized and consequently avoided during the optimization loop.
The procedure is demonstrated for hull shape optimization of the DTMB 5415
model, extensively used as an international benchmark for shape optimization
problems. The global optimization routine is carried out using Bayesian
Optimization and the DIRECT algorithm. From the numerical results, the new
framework improves the convergence of global optimization algorithms, while
only designs with high-quality geometrical features are generated through the
optimization routine thereby avoiding the wastage of precious computationally

employs 3D cylindrical convolutions, which take advantage of symmetries of the
underlying data representation. To handle irregular detector geometries, we
augment the diffusion model with a new geometry latent mapping (GLaM) layer to
learn forward and reverse transformations to a regular geometry that is
suitable for cylindrical convolutions. The showers generated by our approach

energetic storm particle (ESP) properties in 296 fast-forward interplanetary
shocks using ACE measurements at 1 au between 02/1998 - 08/2013. We vary the
time windows from 2-mins to 20-mins for the shock properties and from 2-mins to
540-mins for ESP properties. Variability is quantified by the median absolute
deviation (MAD) statistic. We find that the magnetic, density, and temperature
compression ratios vary from their median values by 17.03%, 20.05%, 25.91%,
respectively; shock speed by 16.26%, speed jump by 45.46%, Alfvenic Mach number

540-min windows downstream of the shock vary from the median value of 1.79 by
26.05%, and by 30.53% from the 1.70 median value upstream of the shock.
Similarity of ESP spectral indices upstream and downstream of the shock suggest
that these ESP populations are likely locally accelerated at the shock.
Furthermore, we find that for a moving sampling window around the shock, values
for the density ratio hold for ~10-mins; the magnetic ratio and shock speed
jump hold for ~30-mins, and ~60-mins, respectively. Fixing the upstream window
to 2-mins and moving only in the downstream direction, then the density ratio
holds for ~60-mins downstream, magnetic ratio for ~30-mins, and the shock speed

To ensure that an unprecedented energy resolution of $\sigma_E/E \leqslant 3\%$

wavelength ranging from 350nm to 450nm.
  In the past decade much effort has been devoted to the development of high

a close cooperation with Jingling Petrochemical Corporation in Nanjing,
transparency of LAB samples prepared for JUNO has been improved progressively.
However, this improvement is also pushing our apparatus towards approaching its

  In this article, we present an analysis of how apparatus upgrading helps with
decreasing measuring errors, and we conducted measurements using the new

the results. We propose to apply statistical methods featuring Monte Carlo

models is also considered and the overall uncertainty is obtained by combining
two independent measurements. We finally report the light attenuation length of

reduce the time and costs associated with unveiling process-property (porosity
defects) relationships during manufacturing. With S-acceleration, part semantic
features from machine-setting parameters and physics-effects informed
characteristics are explored for measuring mutual part similarities. A
user-defined simplification rate of experiments is proposed to purposely remove
redundant parts before conducting experiments printing without sacrificing
information gain as original full factorial experiment design. This
S-acceleration design of experiments is demonstrated on a Concept Laser M2
machine for the experimental plan of modeling relationships between process

mm tall pin geometry considering variations in build location and orientation,
laser settings and powder feedstock are held constant. In total, 242 parts are
measured to create a ground truth data set of porosity levels by using X-ray

characterizing complex systems. This paper presents a framework for sampling
parameter distributions in PC-SAFT and SAFT-VR Mie equations of state to
understand parameter confidence intervals and correlations. We identify
conserved quantities contributing to significant correlations. Comparing the
equations of state, we find that additional parameters introduced in the
SAFT-VR Mie equation increase relative uncertainties (1\%-2\% to 3\%-4\%) and
introduce more correlations. When incorporating association through additional
parameters, relative uncertainties increase, but correlations slightly
decrease. We investigate how uncertainties propagate to derived properties and
observe small uncertainties for that data with which the parameters were
regressed, especially for saturated-liquid volumes. However, extrapolating to
saturated-vapour volumes yields larger uncertainties due to the larger
isothermal compressibility. Near the critical point, uncertainties in saturated
volumes diverge due to increased sensitivity of the isothermal compressibility
to parameter uncertainties. This effect significantly impacts bulk properties,
particularly isobaric heat capacity, where uncertainties near the critical
point become extremely large, even when these uncertainties are small. We
emphasize that even small uncertainties near the critical point lead to
divergences in predicted properties.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.00171v1

examines the impact of assimilating observations from the NASA Soil Moisture
Active Passive (SMAP) mission into the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System

Idai (2019). Two sets of retrospective forecasts of TC Idai are compared in an

analysis that is comparable to the GEOS operational analysis and (ii) forecasts
initialized from an analysis that additionally assimilates SMAP brightness
temperature observations over land. Results indicate that SMAP assimilation
leads to pronounced improvements in the representation of TC Idai structure and
prediction of its intensity and track. The wind speed radius (a measure for TC
compactness) is reduced by up to 18% in the analysis with SMAP assimilation
relative to the control experiment without SMAP assimilation. The forecast
intensity error, measured against the observed intensity, is reduced by up to
23%. The forecast along-track error is reduced by up to 34%, indicating a more
accurate propagation speed, while the impact of SMAP assimilation on the
forecast cross-track error is neutral. These results provide a valuable
demonstration that SMAP assimilation can have a highly beneficial impact on TC

experimental structures require careful review and curation, which is a
time-consuming and error-prone process. Here, we present a fast and robust

sequence analysis and error assessment of a given input structure. ASAP allows
for pKa prediction from reference data through Gaussian process regression

spatiotemporal variability of completeness magnitude Mp. Mp was lower than 1 in

completeness estimates in the area near failure nodes were about 1 magnitude
larger. If such failure occurred for nodes near the region which straddles the
rupture zones of the previous Tonankai and Nankai earthquakes in 1940's, it
would most pronouncedly affect earthquake monitoring among nodes' failures. It

edge reflects the outcome and timing of a pairwise interaction. The inferred
ranking of each node is real-valued and varies in time as each new edge,
encoding an outcome like a win or loss, raises or lowers the node's estimated
strength or prestige, as is often observed in real scenarios including
sequences of games, tournaments, or interactions in animal hierarchies. Our
method works by solving a linear system of equations and requires only one
parameter to be tuned. As a result, the corresponding algorithm is scalable and
efficient. We test our method by evaluating its ability to predict interactions
(edges' existence) and their outcomes (edges' directions) in a variety of
applications, including both synthetic and real data. Our analysis shows that

by collagen content and arrangement. Understanding the relationship between
structure and properties is crucial for disease management, treatment
development, and biomaterial design. The internal layer of the meniscus is
softer and more deformable than the outer layers, thanks to interconnected
collagen channels that guide fluid flow. To investigate these relationships, we
propose a novel approach that combines Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with
Image Analysis (CFD-IA). We analyze fluid flow in the internal architecture of
the human meniscus across a range of inlet velocities (0.1mm/s to 1.6m/s) using
high-resolution 3D micro-computed tomography scans. Statistical correlations
are observed between architectural parameters (tortuosity, connectivity,
porosity, pore size) and fluid flow parameters (Re number distribution,
permeability). Some channels exhibit Re values of 1400 at an inlet velocity of
1.6m/s, and a transition from Darcy's regime to a non-Darcian regime occurs
around an inlet velocity of 0.02m/s. Location-dependent permeability ranges
from 20-32 Darcy. Regression modelling reveals a strong correlation between
fluid velocity and tortuosity at high inlet velocities, as well as with channel
diameter at low inlet velocities. At higher inlet velocities, flow paths
deviate more from the preferential direction, resulting in a decrease in the
concentration parameter by an average of 0.4. This research provides valuable
insights into the fluid flow behaviour within the meniscus and its structural
influences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.13060v1

the temporal changes in network structure. Community detection algorithms,
which are specialized clustering algorithms, have been instrumental in studying
these temporal changes. They work by grouping nodes into communities based on
the structure and intensity of network connections over time aiming to maximize

particular data, has proven to be very relevant in artificial intelligence.
Relative entropy (RE, aka Kullback-Leibler divergence) plays a central role in
communication theory. Here we combine these concepts, attention and RE. RE
guides optimal encoding of messages in bandwidth-limited communication as well
as optimal message decoding via the maximum entropy principle (MEP). In the
coding scenario, RE can be derived from four requirements, namely being
analytical, local, proper, and calibrated. Weighted RE, used for attention
steering in communications, turns out to be improper. To see how proper
attention communication can emerge, we analyze a scenario of a message sender
who wants to ensure that the receiver of the message can perform well-informed
actions. If the receiver decodes the message using the MEP, the sender only
needs to know the receiver's utility function to inform optimally, but not the
receiver's initial knowledge state. In case only the curvature of the utility
function maxima are known, it becomes desirable to accurately communicate an
attention function, in this case a by this curvature weighted and re-normalized
probability function. Entropic attention communication is here proposed as the
desired generalization of entropic communication that permits weighting while
being proper, thereby aiding the design of optimal communication protocols in
technical applications and helping to understand human communication. For

selection methods, or ""cuts"", (the updown and dipole cut) that extend a
previously published analysis to a specialized ARIANNA station with 8 antenna
channels, which is double the number used in the prior analysis. The new cuts
produce a neutrino efficiency of > 95% per station-year, while rejecting 99.93%

empowers users to propose, examine, and publish new likelihood prescriptions
without developing software infrastructure, ultimately unifying and
generalising different ways of constructing likelihoods and employing them for
hypothesis testing, all in one place. Within this package, we propose a new
simplified likelihood prescription that surpasses its predecessors'
approximation accuracy by incorporating asymmetric uncertainties. Furthermore,
our package facilitates the inclusion of various likelihood combination
routines, thereby broadening the scope of independent studies through a
meta-analysis. By remaining agnostic to the source of the likelihood
prescription and the signal hypothesis generator, our platform allows for the
seamless implementation of packages with different likelihood prescriptions,

quantitatively assessing the value of biosignature missions. This makes it
simple to determine how mission value depends on design parameters, prior
knowledge, and input assumptions. We demonstrate the utility of this framework
by applying it to a plethora of case examples: the minimal number of samples
needed to determine a trend in the occurrence rate of a signal as a function of
an environmental variable, and how much cost should be allocated to each class
of object; the relative impact of false positives and false negatives, with
applications to Enceladus data and how best to combine two signals; the optimum
tradeoff between resolution and coverage in the search for lurkers or other
spatially restricted signals, with application to our current state of
knowledge for solar system bodies; the best way to deduce a habitability
boundary; the optimal amount of money to spend on different mission aspects;
when to include an additional instrument on a mission; the optimal mission
lifetime; and when to follow/challenge the predictions of a habitability model.

rationalisation for anomalous scaling in fully developed turbulence. We now
show that this formalism can be adapted locally to reveal the spatial
distribution of generalized dimensions and of how multifractal the energy
dissipation field is. In particular, we show that most regions of the flow are
close to being mono-fractal and these are interspersed with islands of
multifractality corresponding to the most singular structures in the flow. By
defining a suitable measure $\Phi ({\bf x})$ of the spatial variation of
multifractality, we show that this grows logarithmically with the extent to
which the energy dissipation varies locally around ${\bf x}$. These results
suggest ways to understand how singularities could arise in disparate regions
of a flow and provides new directions in understanding anomalous dissipation
and intermittency. We then employ the same technique to a non-intermittent,
model turbulent flow to check the robustness of our conclusions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06074v1

entropy, a standard complexity measure in the literature, and the permutation
entropy of the ordinal transition probability matrix that describes the
transitions between the ordinal patterns derived from a time series. We find
that the permutation entropy based on the ordinal transition matrix outperforms
the rest of the tested measures in discriminating the topological role of
networked chaotic R\""ossler systems. Since the method is based on permutation

synergistically combines domain-aware and interpretable models with agnostic
machine learning techniques. In this work, we introduce GOKU-UI, an evolution
of the SciML generative model GOKU-nets. The GOKU-UI broadens the original
model's spectrum to incorporate other classes of differential equations, such
as Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), and integrates a distributed, i.e.
ubiquitous, inference through attention mechanisms and a novel multiple
shooting training strategy in the latent space. These enhancements have led to
a significant increase in its performance in both reconstruction and forecast
tasks, as demonstrated by our evaluation of simulated and empirical data.
Specifically, GOKU-UI outperformed all baseline models on synthetic datasets
even with a training set 32-fold smaller, underscoring its remarkable data
efficiency. Furthermore, when applied to empirical human brain data, while
incorporating stochastic Stuart-Landau oscillators into its dynamical core, it
not only surpassed state-of-the-art baseline methods in the reconstruction
task, but also demonstrated better prediction of future brain activity up to 12
seconds ahead. By training GOKU-UI on resting-state fMRI data, we encoded
whole-brain dynamics into a latent representation, learning an effective
low-dimensional dynamical system model that could offer insights into brain
functionality and open avenues for practical applications such as mental state

statistical augmentations to complex models across science and engineering. By
augmentation we mean coherent statistical methods that incorporate measurements
upon arrival and adjust the model accordingly. However, in this research area
methodological developments tend to be central, with important assessments of
model fidelity often taking second place. Recently, the statistical finite
element method (statFEM) has been posited as a potential solution to the
problem of model misspecification when the data are believed to be generated
from an underlying partial differential equation system. Bayes nonlinear
filtering permits data driven finite element discretised solutions that are
updated to give a posterior distribution which quantifies the uncertainty over
model solutions. The statFEM has shown great promise in systems subject to mild
misspecification but its ability to handle scenarios of severe model
misspecification has not yet been presented. In this paper we fill this gap,
studying statFEM in the context of shallow water equations chosen for their
oceanographic relevance. By deliberately misspecifying the governing equations,
via linearisation, viscosity, and bathymetry, we systematically analyse
misspecification through studying how the resultant approximate posterior
distribution is affected, under additional regimes of decreasing spatiotemporal
observational frequency. Results show that statFEM performs well with
reasonable accuracy, as measured by theoretically sound proper scoring rules.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05334v1

entropy maximization and study the extent to which ensemble non-equivalence
affects the description length of binary, canonical, and microcanonical models.
Specifically, we consider the description length induced by the Normalized
Maximum Likelihood (NML), which consists of two terms, i.e. a model
log-likelihood and its complexity: while the effects of ensemble
non-equivalence on the log-likelihood term are well understood, its effects on
the complexity term have not been systematically studied yet. Here, we find
that i) microcanonical models are always more complex than their canonical
counterparts and ii) the difference between the canonical and the
microcanonical description length is strongly influenced by the degree of
non-equivalence, a result suggesting that non-equivalence should be taken into
account when selecting models. Finally, we compare the NML-based approach to
model selection with the Bayesian one induced by Jeffreys prior, showing that
the two cannot be reconciled when non-equivalence holds.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05645v1

the future than it can reach via time-respecting paths. This set of nodes
reachable from a source defines an out-component, which identification is
costly. In this paper, we propose an efficient matrix algorithm to tackle this

identifying variation at the scale of the system's components that is most
relevant to behavior on a macroscopic scale. Mutual information is a natural
means of linking variation across scales of a system due to its independence of
the particular functional relationship between variables. However, estimating
mutual information given high-dimensional, continuous-valued data is
notoriously difficult, and the desideratum -- to reveal important variation in
a comprehensible manner -- is only readily achieved through exhaustive search.
Here we propose a practical, efficient, and broadly applicable methodology to
decompose the information contained in a set of measurements by lossily
compressing each measurement with machine learning. Guided by the distributed
information bottleneck as a learning objective, the information decomposition
sorts variation in the measurements of the system state by relevance to
specified macroscale behavior, revealing the most important subsets of
measurements for different amounts of predictive information. Additional
granularity is achieved by inspection of the learned compression schemes: the
variation transmitted during compression is composed of distinctions among
measurement values that are most relevant to the macroscale behavior. We focus
our analysis on two paradigmatic complex systems: a Boolean circuit and an
amorphous material undergoing plastic deformation. In both examples, specific
bits of entropy are identified out of the high entropy of the system state as
most related to macroscale behavior for insight about the connection between
micro- and macro- in the complex system. The identification of meaningful

least-squares hierarchical variational autoencoder (LSH-VAE), is capable of
performing nonlinear MOR for the parametric interpolation of a nonlinear

exploits two major changes to the existing networks: a hierarchical deep
structure and a hybrid weighted, probabilistic loss function. The enhancements
result in a significantly improved accuracy and stability compared against the
conventional nonlinear MOR methods, autoencoder, and variational autoencoder.
Upon LSH-VAE, a parametric MOR framework is presented based on the spherically
linear interpolation of the latent manifold. The present framework is validated
and evaluated on three nonlinear and multiphysics dynamic systems. First, the
present framework is evaluated on the fluid-structure interaction benchmark
problem to assess its efficiency and accuracy. Then, a highly nonlinear
aeroelastic phenomenon, limit cycle oscillation, is analyzed. Finally, the
present framework is applied to a three-dimensional fluid flow to demonstrate
its capability of efficiently analyzing a significantly large number of degrees

Statistical divergences quantify the difference between two distributions.
However, their estimation is very difficult and empirical methods often fail,

Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probability distributions that makes
use of a mixture of Dirichlet priors on the distributions being compared. We
study the properties of the estimator on two examples: probabilities drawn from
Dirichlet distributions, and random strings of letters drawn from Markov

observation of simple dynamical network properties like the activity of nodes

from these representations and compute their Fourier Transform to effectively
identify dominant periodic time scales characterising the original temporal
network. We demonstrate our methods using synthetic and real-world data sets
describing various kinds of temporal networks. We find that while in all cases
the two methods outperform the reference measures, the supra-adjacency based

temporal event graph based method is better suited to detect periodic changes

non-Newtonian fluids can be a daunting task. In this paper we demonstrate how
the framework of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) can be used to improve the
predictive capabilities of rheological models in such flow scenarios. For this
demonstration, we consider the squeeze flow of generalized Newtonian fluids. To
systematically study uncertainties, we have developed a tailored squeeze flow
setup, which we have used to perform experiments with glycerol and PVP
solution. To mimic these experiments, we have developed a three-region
truncated power law model, which can be evaluated semi-analytically. This
fast-to-evaluate model enables us to consider uncertainty propagation and
Bayesian inference using (Markov chain) Monte Carlo techniques. We demonstrate
that with prior information obtained from dedicated experiments - most
importantly rheological measurements - the truncated power law model can
adequately predict the experimental results. We observe that when the squeeze
flow experiments are incorporated in the analysis in the case of Bayesian
inference, this leads to an update of the prior information on the rheological
parameters, giving evidence of the need for recalibration in the considered
complex flow scenario. In the process of Bayesian inference we also obtain
information on quantities of interest that are not directly observable in the
experimental data, such as the spatial distribution of the three flow regimes.
In this way, besides improving the predictive capabilities of the model, the

interest in home dialysis, lower intrusion in social life and longer

However, as more drugs are added to the treatment plan, the risk of adverse

test every possible drug combination during clinical trials. This issue is
particularly prevalent among older adults with cardiovascular disease (CVD)

primary objective was to identify key drug features to build and evaluate a
model for modeling polypharmacy ADEs. Our secondary objective was to assess our
model on a domain-specific case study. We developed a two-layer neural network
that incorporated drug features such as molecular structure, drug-protein
interactions, and mono drug side effects (DrIVeNN). We assessed DrIVeNN using
publicly available side effect databases and determined Principal Component

may move from a microscope to a desktop. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining
is one of the most frequently used stains for disease analysis, diagnosis, and
grading, but pathologists do need different immunohistochemical (IHC) stains to
analyze specific structures or cells. Obtaining all of these stains (H&E and
different IHCs) on a single specimen is a tedious and time-consuming task.
Consequently, virtual staining has emerged as an essential research direction.
Here, we propose a novel generative model, Structural Cycle-GAN (SC-GAN), for
synthesizing IHC stains from H&E images, and vice versa. Our method expressly
incorporates structural information in the form of edges (in addition to color
data) and employs attention modules exclusively in the decoder of the proposed
generator model. This integration enhances feature localization and preserves
contextual information during the generation process. In addition, a structural
loss is incorporated to ensure accurate structure alignment between the
generated and input markers. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model,
experiments are conducted with two IHC markers emphasizing distinct structures
of glands in the colon: the nucleus of epithelial cells (CDX2) and the
cytoplasm (CK818). Quantitative metrics such as FID and SSIM are frequently

data are inherently imbalanced. Challenge #4: Existing VCE AIMLT are
computationally cumbersome. Challenge #5: Clinicians are hesitant to accept
AIMLT that cannot explain their process.
  Methods: An anatomic landmark detection model was used to test the
application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the task of classifying

brain age, which is an important brain health biomarker, from magnetic
resonance (MR) images. However, most of these models only provide a global age
prediction, and rely on techniques, such as saliency maps to interpret their
results. These saliency maps highlight regions in the input image that were
significant for the model's predictions, but they are hard to be interpreted,
and saliency map values are not directly comparable across different samples.
In this work, we reframe the age prediction problem from MR images to an
image-to-image regression problem where we estimate the brain age for each
brain voxel in MR images. We compare voxel-wise age prediction models against
global age prediction models and their corresponding saliency maps. The results

adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Traditional Agatston score simply sums
the calcium, albeit in a non-linear way, leaving room for improved
calcification assessments that will more fully capture the extent of disease.
  Objective. To determine if AI methods using detailed calcification features
(i.e., calcium-omics) can improve MACE prediction.
  Methods. We investigated additional features of calcification including
assessment of mass, volume, density, spatial distribution, territory, etc. We
used a Cox model with elastic-net regularization on 2457 CT calcium score
(CTCS) enriched for MACE events obtained from a large no-cost CLARIFY program
(ClinicalTri-als.gov Identifier: NCT04075162). We employed sampling techniques
to enhance model training. We also investigated Cox models with selected
features to identify explainable high-risk characteristics.
  Results. Our proposed calcium-omics model with modified synthetic down
sampling and up sampling gave C-index (80.5%/71.6%) and two-year AUC
(82.4%/74.8%) for (80:20, training/testing), respectively (sampling was applied
to the training set only). Results compared favorably to Agatston which gave
C-index (71.3%/70.3%) and AUC (71.8%/68.8%), respectively. Among calcium-omics
features, numbers of calcifications, LAD mass, and diffusivity (a measure of
spatial distribution) were important determinants of increased risk, with dense
calcification (>1000HU) associated with lower risk. The calcium-omics model
reclassified 63% of MACE patients to the high risk group in a held-out test.
The categorical net-reclassification index was NRI=0.153.
  Conclusions. AI analysis of coronary calcification can lead to improved
results as compared to Agatston scoring. Our findings suggest the utility of
calcium-omics in improved prediction of risk.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.12224v1

tested on the NLST dataset. The model incorporated features such as age,
gender, smoking history, medical diagnoses, and family history of lung cancer.
The model was well-calibrated (Brier score=0.044). ROC-AUC was 82% on the PLCO

Mental Therapy, Haircut, Studying, and Coursework. To elucidate the topic
emergence and associations with depression, we compared behavioral (from
wearables) and linguistic characteristics across identified topics. The
correlation between topic shifts and changes in depression severity over time
was also investigated, indicating the importance of longitudinally monitoring

proposing high fidelity discrete agent-based models that capture stochasticity
and individual-level processes. These models are often considered in
conjunction with an approximate coarse-grained differential equation that
captures population-level features only. These coarse-grained models are only
accurate in certain asymptotic parameter regimes, such as enforcing that the
time scale of individual motility far exceeds the time scale of birth/death
processes. When these coarse-grained models are accurate, the discrete model
still abides by conservation laws at the microscopic level, which implies that
there is some macroscopic conservation law that can describe the macroscopic
dynamics. In this work, we introduce an equation learning framework to find
accurate coarse-grained models when standard continuum limit approaches are
inaccurate. We demonstrate our approach using a discrete mechanical model of
epithelial tissues, considering a series of four case studies that illustrate
how we can learn macroscopic equations describing mechanical relaxation, cell
proliferation, and the equation governing the dynamics of the free boundary of

previous FL approaches for fMRI analysis often ignore site-specificity,

thought to be possible drivers of mortality for Atlantic Cod (Gadus morhua) on
the Western Scotian Shelf and in the Bay of Fundy (known as ""4X5Y cod"") and in
nearby ecosystems. We developed a statistical catch-at-age model for 4X5Y cod
that accounted for both grey seal predation and estimated bycatch/discards to
evaluate the degree to which either of these factors may influence cod
mortality. The model was fit over a range of predation and discarding scenarios
to account for uncertainties and a lack of data for these processes. We found
that most cod M remained unaccounted for unless cod comprised a large
proportion (>0.45) of the grey seal diet by weight. If the reported bycatch
estimates are taken as accurate, then the magnitude of cod discards from
non-directed fisheries was minor, though these estimates are highly uncertain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08662v1

multiple-sequence alignment (MSA) methods, like PSI-BLAST, perform exhaustive
and time-consuming database search to retrieve evolutionary information. The
resulting position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) of such search engines
represent a crucial input to many machine learning (ML) models in the field of
bioinformatics and computational biology. A protein sequence is a collection of
contiguous tokens or characters called amino acids (AAs). The analogy to
natural language allowed us to exploit the recent advancements in the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and therefore transfer NLP state-of-the-art
algorithms to bioinformatics. This research presents an Embedding Language
Model (ELMo), converting a protein sequence to a numerical vector
representation. While the original ELMo trained a 2-layer bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) network following a two-path architecture, one for
the forward and the second for the backward pass, by merging the idea of PSSMs
with the concept of transfer-learning, this work introduces a novel
bidirectional language model (bi-LM) with four times less free parameters and
using rather a single path for both passes. The model was trained not only on
predicting the next AA but also on the probability distribution of the next AA
derived from similar, yet different sequences as summarized in a PSSM,
simultaneously for multi-task learning, hence learning evolutionary information
of protein sequences as well. The network architecture and the pre-trained

and discovery of materials in diverse applications, such as batteries,
semiconductors, catalysts, and pharmaceuticals. Recently, there has been a
growing interest in employing data-driven approaches by using machine learning
technologies, in combination with conventional theoretical calculations. In
material science, the prediction of unobserved values, commonly referred to as
extrapolation, is particularly critical for property prediction as it enables
researchers to gain insight into materials beyond the limits of available data.
However, even with the recent advancements in powerful machine learning models,
accurate extrapolation is still widely recognized as a significantly
challenging problem. On the other hand, self-supervised pretraining is a
machine learning technique where a model is first trained on unlabeled data
using relatively simple pretext tasks before being trained on labeled data for
target tasks. As self-supervised pretraining can effectively utilize material
data without observed property values, it has the potential to improve the
model's extrapolation ability. In this paper, we clarify how such
self-supervised pretraining can enhance extrapolation performance.We propose an
experimental framework for the demonstration and empirically reveal that while
models were unable to accurately extrapolate absolute property values,
self-supervised pretraining enables them to learn relative tendencies of
unobserved property values and improve extrapolation performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08129v1

nuclei cells over background tissue and gives rise to the topology, size, and
count of nuclei which are determinant factors for cancer detection. Yet, it is
a fairly time consuming task for pathologists, with reportedly high
subjectivity. Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) tools empowered by modern
Artificial Intelligence (AI) models enable the automation of nuclei
segmentation. This can reduce the subjectivity in analysis and reading time.

traditional image processing techniques and reaching up to modern approaches

supervision aspect of the problem, motivated by the fact that annotated data is
scarce. At the end, the advantages of different models and types of supervision
are thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, we try to extrapolate and envision how

quantifying shape in complex data. Standard methods in TDA such as persistent

single entity (e.g., cells or molecular species). However, state-of-the-art
data collection techniques now generate exquisitely detailed multispecies data,
prompting a need for methods that can examine and quantify the relations among
them. Such heterogeneous data types arise in many contexts, ranging from
biomedical imaging, geospatial analysis, to species ecology. Here, we propose
two methods for encoding spatial relations among different data types that are
based on Dowker complexes and Witness complexes. We apply the methods to
synthetic multispecies data of a tumor microenvironment and analyze topological
features that capture relations between different cell types, e.g., blood
vessels, macrophages, tumor cells, and necrotic cells. We demonstrate that
relational topological features can extract biological insight, including the
dominant immune cell phenotype (an important predictor of patient prognosis)
and the parameter regimes of a data-generating model. The methods provide a
quantitative perspective on the relational analysis of multispecies spatial

sequence-based models of protein relatedness, that have clear limitations
dealing with twilight and midnight zones of sequence relationships. Since
protein structures are far more conserved due to the selection pressure
directly placed on their function, divergence time estimates can be more
accurate when inferred from structures. We use the Bayesian and
information-theoretic framework of Minimum Message Length to infer a
time-parameterized stochastic matrix (accounting for perturbed structural
states of related residues) and associated Dirichlet models (accounting for
insertions and deletions during the evolution of protein domains). These are
used in concert to estimate the Markov time of divergence of tertiary
structures, a task previously only possible using proxies (like RMSD). By
analyzing one million pairs of homologous structures, we yield a relationship
between the Markov divergence time of structures and of sequences. Using these
inferred models and the relationship between the divergence of sequences and

capillaries, play a pivotal role in maintaining renal health. The current
description and quantification of features on pathology slides are limited,
prompting the need for innovative solutions to comprehensively assess diverse
phenotypic attributes within Whole Slide Images (WSIs). In particular,
understanding the morphological characteristics of podocytes, terminally
differentiated glomerular epithelial cells, is crucial for studying glomerular
injury. This paper introduces the Spatial Pathomics Toolkit (SPT) and applies
it to podocyte pathomics. The SPT consists of three main components: (1)
instance object segmentation, enabling precise identification of podocyte
nuclei; (2) pathomics feature generation, extracting a comprehensive array of
quantitative features from the identified nuclei; and (3) robust statistical
analyses, facilitating a comprehensive exploration of spatial relationships
between morphological and spatial transcriptomics features.The SPT successfully
extracted and analyzed morphological and textural features from podocyte

statistical analysis. Additionally, we demonstrated the SPT's ability to
unravel spatial information inherent to podocyte distribution, shedding light
on spatial patterns associated with glomerular injury. By disseminating the

of pathology in the brain during neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's
disease. Previous studies have made specific choices on the mechanisms of
pathology production and diffusion, or assume that all the subjects lie on the

of neurodegenerative pathology suggests that multiple mechanisms may contribute
synergistically with complex interactions, meanwhile the degree of contribution
of each mechanism may vary among individuals. We thus put forward a
coupled-mechanisms modelling framework which non-linearly combines the
network-topology-informed pathology appearance with the process of pathology
spreading within a dynamic modelling system. We account for the heterogeneity
of disease by fitting the model at the individual level, allowing the
epicenters and rate of progression to vary among subjects. We construct a
Bayesian model selection framework to account for feature importance and
parameter uncertainty. This provides a combination of mechanisms that best
explains the observations for each individual from the ADNI dataset. With the

networks, uncertainty quantification (UQ) and sensitivity analysis (SA).
Estimating parameters and quantifying their uncertainty (and resulting
prediction uncertainty), is required for data-driven systems biology modeling.
Sampling methods need to be efficient when confronted with high-dimensional,
correlated parameter distributions. We have developed the UQSA package to be
fast for this problem class and work well with other tools for modelling. We
aim for simplicity, and part of that is our use of the SBtab format for the
unified storage of model and data. Our tool-set is modular enough, that parts
can be replaced. We use intermediate formats that are not hidden from the user
to make this feasible. UQ is performed through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampling in an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) setting. This can be
followed by a variance-decomposition based global sensitivity analysis. If
needed, complex parameter distributions can be described, evaluated, and
sampled from, with the help of Vine-copulas that are available in R. This
approach is especially useful when new experimental data become available, and
a previously calibrated model needs to be updated.
  Implementation: R is a high-level language and allows the use of
sophisticated statistical methods. The ode solver we used is written in C
(gsl_odeiv2, interface to R is ours). We use the SBtab tabular format for the
model description, as well as the data and an event system to be able to model
inputs frequently encountered in systems biology and neuroscience. The code has

has become apparent that they often produce physically implausible molecular
structures. It is therefore not sufficient to evaluate these methods solely by
RMSD to a native binding mode. It is vital, particularly for deep
learning-based methods, that they are also evaluated on steric and energetic
criteria. We present PoseBusters, a Python package that performs a series of
standard quality checks using the well-established cheminformatics toolkit
RDKit. Only methods that both pass these checks and predict native-like binding
modes should be classed as having ``state-of-the-art'' performance. We use
PoseBusters to compare five deep learning-based docking methods (DeepDock,
DiffDock, EquiBind, TankBind, and Uni-Mol) and two well-established standard
docking methods (AutoDock Vina and CCDC Gold) with and without an additional
post-prediction energy minimisation step using a molecular mechanics force
field. We show that both in terms of physical plausibility and the ability to
generalise to examples that are distinct from the training data, no deep
learning-based method yet outperforms classical docking tools. In addition, we
find that molecular mechanics force fields contain docking-relevant physics
missing from deep-learning methods. PoseBusters allows practitioners to assess

(projection angles and image translation) in cryo-EM experiments,
reconstructing 3D structures from 2D images is very challenging. On top of
these challenges, heterogeneous cryo-EM reconstruction also has an additional
requirement: conformation classification. An emerging solution to this problem
is called amortized inference, implemented using the autoencoder architecture
or its variants. Instead of searching for the correct
image-to-pose/conformation mapping for every image in the dataset as in
non-amortized methods, amortized inference only needs to train an encoder that
maps images to appropriate latent spaces representing poses or conformations.
Unfortunately, standard amortized-inference-based methods with entangled latent
spaces have difficulty learning the distribution of conformations and poses
from cryo-EM images. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised deep learning
architecture called ""ACE-HetEM"" based on amortized inference. To explicitly
enforce the disentanglement of conformation classifications and pose
estimations, we designed two alternating training tasks in our method:
image-to-image task and pose-to-pose task. Results on simulated datasets show

inherent risks, making it a potentially dangerous procedure for some patients.
Approaches that leverage non-invasive signals - such as electrocardiogram (ECG)

microbundle contraction reported in the field (i.e., post forces, average
tissue stress) do not take full advantage of the available information present
in these data (i.e., full-field tissue displacements and strains). Thus, we
present ""MicroBundleCompute,"" a computational framework for automatic
quantification of morphology-based mechanical metrics from movies of cardiac
microbundles. Briefly, this computational framework offers tools for automatic
tissue segmentation, tracking, and analysis of brightfield and phase contrast
movies of beating cardiac microbundles. It is straightforward to implement,
requires little to no parameter tuning, and runs quickly on a personal
computer. In this paper, we describe the methods underlying this computational
framework, show the results of our extensive validation studies, and
demonstrate the utility of exploring heterogeneous tissue deformations and
strains as functional metrics. With this manuscript, we disseminate
""MicroBundleCompute"" as an open-source computational tool with the aim of
making automated quantitative analysis of beating cardiac microbundles more

its study would benefit greatly from multimodal approaches that combine data
from widely varying platforms, e.g., neuroimaging, genetics, and clinical
characterization. Prior neuroimaging-genetic analyses often apply naive feature
concatenation approaches in data-driven work or use the findings from one
modality to guide posthoc analysis of another, missing the opportunity to
analyze the paired multimodal data in a truly unified approach. In this paper,
we develop a more integrative model for combining genetic, demographic, and
neuroimaging data. Inspired by the influence of genotype on phenotype, we
propose using an attention-based approach where the genetic data guides
attention to neuroimaging features of importance for model prediction. The
genetic data is derived from copy number variation parameters, while the
neuroimaging data is from functional magnetic resonance imaging. We evaluate
the proposed approach on ASD classification and severity prediction tasks,
using a sex-balanced dataset of 228 ASD and typically developing subjects in a
10-fold cross-validation framework. We demonstrate that our attention-based
model combining genetic information, demographic data, and functional magnetic
resonance imaging results in superior prediction performance compared to other
multimodal approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.05122v1

caused by the interaction between light and biochemical components during the

super-resolution microscopy or thick sample imaging, are particularly
susceptible to this issue. As part of the solution to these problems, advanced
imaging approaches involving artificial intelligence (AI) have been developed.
Here we underscore the necessity of establishing constraints to maintain
light-induced damage at levels that permit cells to sustain their live

significant potential in aiding the development of AI-enhanced

extract an unsatisfactory representation. Inspired by Broadbent's filter model,
we decode auditory attention in a multi-view paradigm and extract the most
relevant and important information utilizing the missing view. Specifically, we
propose an auditory attention decoding (AAD) method based on multi-view VAE
with task-related multi-view contrastive (TMC) learning. Employing TMC learning
in multi-view VAE can utilize the missing view to accumulate prior knowledge of
different views into the fusion of representation, and extract the approximate

we introduce PTransIPs, a novel deep learning model for the identification of
phosphorylation sites. PTransIPs treat amino acids within protein sequences as
words, extracting unique encodings based on their type and sequential position.
The model also incorporates embeddings from large pretrained protein models as
additional data inputs. PTransIPS is further trained on a combination model of
convolutional neural network with residual connections and Transformer model
equipped with multi-head attention mechanisms. At last, the model outputs
classification results through a fully connected layer. The results of
independent testing reveal that PTransIPs outperforms existing

medicine, and are currently at the forefront of biopharmaceutical product
development. However, the growing market demand and the substantial doses
required for mAb clinical treatments necessitate significant progress in its
large-scale production. Most of the processes for industrial mAb production
rely on batch operations, which result in significant downtime. The shift
towards a fully continuous and integrated manufacturing process holds the
potential to boost product yield and quality, while eliminating the extra
expenses associated with storing intermediate products. The integrated
continuous mAb production process can be divided into the upstream and
downstream processes. One crucial aspect that ensures the continuity of the
integrated process is the switching of the capture columns, which are typically
chromatography columns operated in a fed-batch manner downstream. Due to the
discrete nature of the switching operation, advanced process control algorithms
such as economic MPC (EMPC) are computationally difficult to implement. This is
because an integer nonlinear program (INLP) needs to be solved online at each
sampling time. This paper introduces two computationally-efficient approaches
for EMPC implementation, namely, a sigmoid function approximation approach and
a rectified linear unit (ReLU) approximation approach. It also explores the
application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). These three methods are

shown the potential to streamline this process. However, it cannot build a
complete structure due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) problem. At the
same time, AlphaFold has led to a great breakthrough in predicting protein
structures. This has inspired us to combine fragment recognition and structure
prediction methods to build a complete structure. In this paper, we propose a
new method named FFF that bridges protein structure prediction and protein
structure recognition with flexible fitting. First, a multi-level recognition
network is used to capture various structural features from the input 3D
cryo-EM map. Next, protein structural fragments are generated using pseudo

traditional machine learning methods cannot consider the regulatory

TransGeneSelector, that can mine critical regulatory genes involved in certain
life processes using a small-sample transcriptome dataset. The method combines
a WGAN-GP data augmentation network, a sample filtering network, and a
Transformer classifier network, which successfully classified the state
(germinating or dry seeds) of Arabidopsis thaliana seed in a dataset of 79
samples, showing performance comparable to that of Random Forests. Further,
through the use of SHapley Additive exPlanations method, TransGeneSelector
successfully mined genes involved in seed germination. Through the construction
of gene regulatory networks and the enrichment analysis of KEGG, as well as
RT-qPCR quantitative analysis, it was confirmed that these genes are at a more
upstream regulatory level than those Random Forests mined, and the top 11 genes

areas, including healthcare. However, it is also facing a reproducibility

different patient populations or acquisition instrument settings and protocols.
We tackle this problem in the context of neuroimaging of Alzheimer's disease
(AD), schizophrenia (SZ) and brain aging. We develop a weighted empirical risk
minimization approach that optimally combines data from a source group, e.g.,
subjects are stratified by attributes such as sex, age group, race and clinical
cohort to make predictions on a target group, e.g., other sex, age group, etc.
using a small fraction (10%) of data from the target group. We apply this
method to multi-source data of 15,363 individuals from 20 neuroimaging studies
to build ML models for diagnosis of AD and SZ, and estimation of brain age. We
found that this approach achieves substantially better accuracy than existing
domain adaptation techniques: it obtains area under curve greater than 0.95 for
AD classification, area under curve greater than 0.7 for SZ classification and
mean absolute error less than 5 years for brain age prediction on all target
groups, achieving robustness to variations of scanners, protocols, and
demographic or clinical characteristics. In some cases, it is even better than
training on all data from the target group, because it leverages the diversity
and size of a larger training set. We also demonstrate the utility of our
models for prognostic tasks such as predicting disease progression in
individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Critically, our brain age

address this issue, we aimed to develop a new deep-learning based tracking
method that relies solely on the assumption that cells can be tracked based on
their spatio-temporal neighborhood, without restricting it to consecutive
frames. The proposed method has the additional benefit that the motion patterns
of the cells can be learned completely by the predictor without any prior

between individual components (""microscopic description"") to the global
properties of the system (""macroscopic description""). Another fundamental
question is whether such a macroscopic description exists at all and how well
it describes the large-scale properties. Here, we address these questions using
as a canonical example of a self-organizing complex system - the collective
motion of desert locusts. One of the world's most devastating insect plagues
begins when flightless juvenile locusts form ""marching bands"". Moving through
semiarid habitats in the search for food, these bands display remarkable
coordinated motion. We investigated how well physical models can describe the
flow of locusts within a band. For this, we filmed locusts within marching
bands during an outbreak in Kenya and automatically tracked all individuals
passing through the camera frame. We first analysed the spatial topology of
nearest neighbors and found individuals to be isotropically distributed.
Despite this apparent randomness, a local order was observed in regions of high
density with a clear second neighbor peak in the radial distribution function,
akin to an ordered fluid. Furthermore, reconstructing individual locust
trajectories revealed a highly-aligned movement, consistent with the
one-dimensional version of the Toner-Tu equations, which are a generalization
of the Navier-Stokes equations for fluids, used to describe the equivalent
macroscopic fluid properties of active particles. Using this effective Toner-Tu
equation, which relates the gradient of the pressure to the acceleration, we
show that the effective ""pressure"" of locusts increases as a linear function of
density in segments with highest polarization. Our study thus demonstrates an
effective hydrodynamic description of flow dynamics in plague locust swarms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02589v1

PR, and HER2 statuses. The dataset is composed of mirrored images of H\&E and
corresponding images of immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays (Ki67, ER, PR, and

individual pairs were inspected and discarded if artifacts were present (tissue
folding, bubbles, etc). Measurements for Ki67, ER and PR were determined by
calculating H-Score from image analysis. HER2 measurement is based on binary
classification: 0 and 1+ (IHC scores representing a negative subset) vs 3+ (IHC
score positive subset). Cases with IHC equivocal score (2+) were excluded. We
show that a standard ViT-based pipeline can achieve prediction performances
around 90% in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC) when trained with a proper

In particular, we lack a rigorous statistical test for whether two
high-dimensional single-cell datasets are alignable (and therefore should even
be aligned). Moreover, popular methods can substantially distort the data
during alignment, making the aligned data and downstream analysis difficult to
interpret. To overcome these limitations, we present a spectral manifold
alignment and inference (SMAI) framework, which enables principled and
interpretable alignability testing and structure-preserving integration of
single-cell data. SMAI provides a statistical test to robustly determine the
alignability between datasets to avoid misleading inference, and is justified
by high-dimensional statistical theory. On a diverse range of real and
simulated benchmark datasets, it outperforms commonly used alignment methods.
Moreover, we show that SMAI improves various downstream analyses such as

unknowingly inflate classification results from 61% accuracy to 86% accuracy by
treating longitudinal or contemporaneous scans of the same subject as
independent data points. Using the UK Biobank dataset, we find one can achieve
the same level of variance explained with 50 training subjects by exploiting
identifiability as with 10,000 training subjects without double-dipping. We
replicate this effect in four different datasets: the UK Biobank (UKB), the

to express an underlying dynamical law which possesses the fundamental property
of generalized homogeneity with respect to time. Thus, the modeling formalism
enables the encoder output to be interpreted as kinetic rate metrics, with

In this work, we propose a vision transformer-based framework for
distinguishing DLBCL (Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma) cancer subtypes from

way that their neighbours form maximally nested sets, a problem called nested

instance of the Quadratic Assignment Problem, one of the most important
combinatorial optimization problem widely studied in computer science,

construction uses the parallel uniformly controlled rotation gates, which were
used in previous work to generate QBArt encodings. These circuits have a high
degree of quantum parallelism which reduces their critical depth. The optimal
number of repetitions of the Grover iterator used in QCAM depends on the number
of true matches and hence is input dependent. We additionally propose a

Existing embedding techniques either do not utilize velocity information or
embed the coordinates and velocities independently, i.e., they either impose
velocities on top of an existing point embedding or embed points within a
prescribed vector field. Here we present FlowArtist, a neural network that
embeds points while jointly learning a vector field around the points. The
combination allows FlowArtist to better separate and visualize

test the global null hypothesis of no dependence between a response variable
and $p$ predictors, where $n$ observations with $n < p$ are available. The
proposed procedure is similar to the F-test for a linear model, which evaluates
significance based on the ratio of explained to unexplained variance. However,
the F-test is not suitable for models where $p \geq n$. This limitation is due
to the fact that when $p \geq n$, the unexplained variance is zero and thus the
F-statistic can no longer be calculated. In contrast, the proposed extension of
the LASSO methodology overcomes this limitation by using the number of non-zero
coefficients in the LASSO model as a test statistic after suitably specifying
the regularization parameter. The method allows reliable analysis of
high-dimensional datasets with as few as $n = 40$ observations. The performance
of the method is tested by means of a power study.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16374v1

millions of people every year and presenting substantial challenges to

role in disease control and transmission prevention. Group testing is a
well-established method for reducing the number of tests needed to screen large
populations when the disease prevalence is low. However, it does not fully
utilize the quantitative information provided by qPCR methods, nor is it able
to accommodate a wide range of pathogen loads. To address these issues, we
introduce a novel adaptive semi-quantitative group testing (SQGT) scheme to
efficiently screen populations via two-stage qPCR testing. The SQGT method
quantizes cycle threshold ($Ct$) values into multiple bins, leveraging the
information from the first stage of screening to improve the detection
sensitivity. Dynamic $Ct$ threshold adjustments mitigate dilution effects and
enhance test accuracy. Comparisons with traditional binary outcome GT methods

These collections are often characterized by being high-dimensional,
overlapping, and redundant families of sets, thus precluding a straightforward
interpretation and study of their content. Bioinformatics looked for solutions
to reduce their dimension or increase their intepretability. One possibility
lies in aggregating overlapping gene sets to create larger pathways, but the
modified biological pathways are hardly biologically justifiable. We propose to
use importance scores to rank the pathways in the collections studying the
context from a set covering perspective. The proposed Shapley values-based
scores consider the distribution of the singletons and the size of the sets in
the families; Furthermore, a trick allows us to circumvent the usual
exponential complexity of Shapley values' computation. Finally, we address the
challenge of including a redundancy awareness in the obtained rankings where,
in our case, sets are redundant if they show prominent intersections.
  The rankings can be used to reduce the dimension of collections of gene sets,
such that they show lower redundancy and still a high coverage of the genes. We
further investigate the impact of our selection on Gene Sets Enrichment
Analysis. The proposed method shows a practical utility in bioinformatics to
increase the interpretability of the collections of gene sets and a step

phenotypes in a training cohort (n=41,502). Model and hyper-parameters were
chosen based on a validation cohort (n=17,415). Test cohort (n=16,845) was used
to analyze reproducibility and correlation with biomarkers. The training,
validation, and testing cohorts had similar distributions of age (54-55 yrs),
sex (55% female), race, comorbidities, and illness severity. Four clusters were

channel and demonstrate mathematically that this biological machine has
information-processing capabilities that have not been recognized previously.
In particular, we calculate bounds on the ribosome's theoretical Shannon
capacity and numerically approximate this capacity. Finally, by incorporating
estimates on the ribosome's operation time, we show that the ribosome operates

for capturing 3D tissue morphologies have been developed, but they have yet had
little translation to clinical practice; manual and computational evaluations
of such large 3D data have so far been impractical and/or unable to provide
patient-level clinical insights. Here we present Modality-Agnostic Multiple
instance learning for volumetric Block Analysis (MAMBA), a deep-learning-based
platform for processing 3D tissue images from diverse imaging modalities and
predicting patient outcomes. Archived prostate cancer specimens were imaged
with open-top light-sheet microscopy or microcomputed tomography and the
resulting 3D datasets were used to train risk-stratification networks based on
5-year biochemical recurrence outcomes via MAMBA. With the 3D block-based
approach, MAMBA achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic

of greater tissue volume improves prognostic performance and mitigates risk
prediction variability from sampling bias, suggesting the value of capturing
larger extents of heterogeneous 3D morphology. With the rapid growth and

the proposed techniques to inspect the trained model. The gradient-based
visualization not only identifies cells that are most significant for a
particular prediction but also indicates the directions in the FCM feature
space in which changes have the most impact on the prediction. The attention

insufficient light or nutrient supply, as well as excessive wind, (formerly

means to detect certain illnesses, since some diseases like the apple
proliferation disease, an infection with the barley yellow dwarf virus or plant
canker can cause abnormal growth, like \enquote{witches' brooms} or burls,
resulting in a deviating 3D plant architecture. However, quantifying imbalance
of plant growth is not an easy task, and it requires a mathematically sound 3D
model of plants to which imbalance indices can be applied. Current models of
plants are often based on stacked cylinders or voxel matrices and do not allow
for measuring the degree of 3D imbalance in the branching structure of the
whole plant.
  On the other hand, various imbalance indices are readily available for
so-called graph-theoretical trees and are frequently used in areas like
phylogenetics and computer science. While only some basic ideas of these

logical foundation for 3D plant models that allow for elegant and natural
imbalance measures.
  In this manuscript, our aim is thus threefold: We first present a new
graph-theoretical 3D model of plants and discuss desirable properties of
imbalance measures in the 3D setting. We then introduce and analyze eight

ability to deliver large quantities of image-based data powering the
versatility of phenotypic drug screening and systems biology applications.
However, as the sizes of image-based datasets grew, it became infeasible for
humans to control, avoid and overcome the presence of imaging and sample
preparation artefacts in the images. While novel techniques like machine
learning and deep learning may address these shortcomings through generative
image inpainting, when applied to sensitive research data this may come at the
cost of undesired image manipulation. Undesired manipulation may be caused by
phenomena such as neural hallucinations, to which some artificial neural
networks are prone. To address this, here we evaluate the state-of-the-art
inpainting methods for image restoration in a high-content fluorescence
microscopy dataset of cultured cells with labelled nuclei. We show that
architectures like DeepFill V2 and Edge Connect can faithfully restore
microscopy images upon fine-tuning with relatively little data. Our results
demonstrate that the area of the region to be restored is of higher importance
than shape. Furthermore, to control for the quality of restoration, we propose
a novel phenotype-preserving metric design strategy. In this strategy, the size
and count of the restored biological phenotypes like cell nuclei are quantified
to penalise undesirable manipulation. We argue that the design principles of
our approach may also generalise to other applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14436v3

injury such as a stroke. It is hypothesized that the healthy brain operates
near a phase transition (critical point), which provides optimal conditions for
information transmission and responses to inputs. If structural damage could
cause the critical point to disappear and thus make self-organized criticality
unachievable, it would offer the theoretical explanation for the post-stroke
impairment of brain function. In our contribution, however, we demonstrate
using network models of the brain, that the dynamics remain critical even after
a stroke. In cases where the average size of the second-largest cluster of
active nodes, which is one of the commonly used indicators of criticality,
shows an anomalous behavior, it results from the loss of integrity of the
network, quantifiable within graph theory, and not from genuine non-critical
dynamics. We propose a new simple model of an artificial stroke that explains
this anomaly. The proposed interpretation of the results is confirmed by an
analysis of real connectomes acquired from post-stroke patients and a control
group. The results presented refer to neurobiological data; however, the
conclusions reached apply to a broad class of complex systems that admit a
critical state.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14099v1

spatial structuring, from the formations of herds and swarms to territorial
segregation. We examine the derivation of these models from an individual
level, illustrating in the process methods that allow models to be connected to

such as vanishing gradients and overfitting when training on limited data. We
thus develop a topology-based approach that extracts multi-scale topological
features from bags of single red blood cell images. The topological features
are used to regularize the model, enforcing the preservation of characteristic
topological properties of the data. Applied to a dataset of 71 patients
suffering from rare anemia disorders with 521 microscopic images of red blood

challenging. Motivated by advances in simulation-based inference (SBI), we cast
this inverse problem as statistical inference. In contrast to alternative
approaches, SBI provides \textit{posterior distributions} for the parameters of

between individuals generated during the TCR V(D)J recombination is maintained
through all stages of T cell maturation and differentiation. The
inter-individual variability of repertoires of the same cell type is of
comparable magnitude to the variability across cell types within the same
individual. To zoom in on smaller scales than whole repertoires, we defined a

the intensification of feed-food competition. Although chemical inhibitors have
demonstrated effectiveness in manipulating the rumen microbiota to reduce net
emissions, their success is constrained in terms of duration and feasibility in

the rumen has been hampered by the thermodynamic cost of the reaction and the
limited hydrogen levels in the rumen environment. We believe that CRISPR may

pathological cascades. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been successfully
applied to the processing of possibly noisy continuous signals. The aim was to
improve the application HMMs to multivariate time-series of categorically
distributed data. Here, we used HHMs to study prediction of the loss of free
walking ability as one major clinical deterioration in the most common
autosomal dominantly inherited ataxia disorder worldwide. We used HHMs to
investigate the prediction of loss of the ability to walk freely, representing
a major clinical deterioration in the most common autosomal-dominant inherited

  Results: We present a prediction pipeline which processes data paired with a
configuration file, enabling to construct, validate and query a fully
parameterized HMM-based model. In particular, we provide a theoretical and
practical framework for multivariate time-series inference based on HMMs that
includes constructing multiple HMMs, each to predict a particular observable
variable. Our analysis is done on random data, but also on biomedical data

challenging tasks in the field of artificial intelligence-based drug design.
Among the current mainstream methods, the most commonly used feature
representation for training DNN models is based on SMILES and molecular graphs,
although these methods are concise and effective, they also limit the ability
to capture spatial information. In this work, we propose Curvature-based
Transformer to improve the ability of Graph Transformer neural network models
to extract structural information on molecular graph data by introducing
Discretization of Ricci Curvature. To embed the curvature in the model, we add
the curvature information of the graph as positional Encoding to the node
features during the attention-score calculation. This method can introduce
curvature information from graph data without changing the original network
architecture, and it has the potential to be extended to other models. We
performed experiments on chemical molecular datasets including PCQM4M-LST,
MoleculeNet and compared with models such as Uni-Mol, Graphormer, and the
results show that this method can achieve the state-of-the-art results. It is
proved that the discretized Ricci curvature also reflects the structural and

high-throughput profiling of metagenomes and accelerated the microbiome study.
Recently, there has been a rise in quantitative studies that aim to decipher
the microbiome co-occurrence network and its underlying community structure

structure is essential to understanding the role of the microbiome in disease
progression and susceptibility. Taxonomic abundance data generated from
metagenomic sequencing technologies are high-dimensional and compositional,
suffering from uneven sampling depth, over-dispersion, and zero-inflation.
These characteristics often challenge the reliability of the current methods
for microbiome community detection. To this end, we propose a Bayesian
stochastic block model to study the microbiome co-occurrence network based on
the recently developed modified centered-log ratio transformation tailored for
microbiome data analysis. Our model allows us to incorporate taxonomic tree
information using a Markov random field prior. The model parameters are jointly
inferred by using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques. Our simulation
study showed that the proposed approach performs better than competing methods
even when taxonomic tree information is non-informative. We applied our

This type of data consists of values from disjoint categories that sum up to a

because it quantifies the flexibility of a fitting procedure and is
indispensable in model selection. The $\df$ is often intuitively equated with
the number of independent variables in the fitting procedure. But for adaptive
regressions that perform variable selection (e.g., the best subset
regressions), the model $\df$ is larger than the number of selected variables.
The excess part has been defined as the \emph{search degrees of freedom}
($\sdf$) to account for model selection. However, this definition is limited
since it does not consider fitting procedures in augmented space, such as
splines and regression trees; and it does not use the same fitting procedure
for $\sdf$ and $\df$. For example, the lasso's $\sdf$ is defined through the
\emph{relaxed} lasso's $\df$ instead of the lasso's $\df$.
  Here we propose a \emph{modified search degrees of freedom} ($\msdf$) to
directly account for the cost of searching in the original or augmented space.
Since many fitting procedures can be characterized by a linear operator, we
define the search cost as the effort to determine such a linear operator. When
we construct a linear operator for the lasso via the iterative ridge
regression, $\msdf$ offers a new perspective for its search cost. For some
complex procedures such as the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS),
the search cost needs to be pre-determined to serve as a tuning parameter for
the procedure itself, but it might be inaccurate. To investigate the inaccurate
pre-determined search cost, we develop two concepts, \emph{nominal} $\df$ and
\emph{actual} $\df$, and formulate a property named \emph{self-consistency}

SSPR retains the node strength distributions and network sparsity after

time-variable of quantum mechanics is promoted to the quantum realm by
introducing a Hilbert space of ""clock"" qubits which are then entangled with the

over $N$ different times of many-body systems by only using $\log(N)$ clock
qubits. As such, we achieve an exponential trade-off between time and spatial
complexities. In addition, we rigorously prove that the entanglement created
between the system qubits and the clock qubits has operational meaning, as it
encodes valuable information about the system's dynamics. We also provide a
circuit depth estimation of all the protocols, showing an exponential advantage
in computation times over traditional sequential in time algorithms. In
particular, for the case when the dynamics are determined by the Aubry-Andre

more appropriate to assume that the distribution of multinomial responses is
conditioned on a subject-specific consideration set, where this consideration
set is drawn from the power set of {1,2,...,J}. Because the cardinality of this
power set is exponential in J, estimation is infeasible in general. In this
paper, we provide an approach to overcoming this problem. A key step in the
approach is a probability model over consideration sets, based on a general
representation of probability distributions on contingency tables. Although the
support of this distribution is exponentially large, the posterior distribution
over consideration sets given parameters is typically sparse, and is easily
sampled as part of an MCMC scheme that iterates sampling of subject-specific

to flag suspicious claims. Feeding learning methods with features engineered
from the social network of parties involved in a claim is a particularly
promising strategy (see for example Van Vlasselaer et al. (2016); Tumminello et
al. (2023)). When developing a fraud detection model, however, we are
confronted with several challenges. The uncommon nature of fraud, for example,
creates a high class imbalance which complicates the development of well
performing analytic classification models. In addition, only a small number of
claims are investigated and get a label, which results in a large corpus of
unlabeled data. Yet another challenge is the lack of publicly available data.
This hinders not only the development of new methods, but also the validation
of existing techniques. We therefore design a simulation machine that is

connectivity, dynamics, and performance. As physical reservoir computers become
more prevalent, developing a systematic approach to network design is crucial.
In this article, we examine Random Boolean Networks (RBNs) and demonstrate that
specific distribution parameters can lead to diverse dynamics near critical
points. We identify distinct dynamical attractors and quantify their
statistics, revealing that most reservoirs possess a dominant attractor. We
then evaluate performance in two challenging tasks, memorization and
prediction, and find that a positive excitatory balance produces a critical
point with higher memory performance. In comparison, a negative inhibitory
balance delivers another critical point with better prediction performance.
Interestingly, we show that the intrinsic attractor dynamics have little

RJMCMC can be challenge, making it hard to implement. Alternatively, the
marginal likelihood can be derived using data-augmentation scheme e.g.
Polya-gamma data argumentation for logistic regression) or through other
estimation methods. However, suitable data-augmentation schemes are not
available for every generalised linear and survival models, and using
estimations such as Laplace approximation or correlated pseudo-marginal to
derive marginal likelihood within a locally informed proposal can be
computationally expensive in the ""large n, large p"" settings. In this paper,
three main contributions are presented. Firstly, we present an extended
Point-wise implementation of Adaptive Random Neighbourhood Informed proposal

in the light of the approximate Laplace approximation, we also describe an
efficient and accurate estimation method for the marginal likelihood which

the algorithmic tuning parameters of the PARNI proposal by replacing the
Rao-Blackwellised estimates with the combination of a warm-start estimate and
an ergodic average. We present numerous numerical results from simulated data

experimentation is that in settings where a functional CLT on the point
estimator is in effect, using \emph{large overlapping batches} alongside OB-x
critical values yields confidence intervals that are often of significantly
higher quality than those obtained from more generic methods like subsampling

estimation of the orientation distribution function (ODF), which encodes key
local tissue properties. However, estimating the ODF from diffusion MRI (dMRI)
signals is a challenging inverse problem due to obstacles such as significant
noise, high-dimensional parameter spaces, and sparse angular measurements. In
this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a novel deep-learning
based methodology for continuous estimation and uncertainty quantification of
the spatially varying ODF field. We use a neural field (NF) to parameterize a
random series representation of the latent ODFs, implicitly modeling the often
ignored but valuable spatial correlation structures in the data, and thereby
improving efficiency in sparse and noisy regimes. An analytic approximation to
the posterior predictive distribution is derived which can be used to quantify
the uncertainty in the ODF estimate at any spatial location, avoiding the need
for expensive resampling-based approaches that are typically employed for this
purpose. We present empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real in-vivo
diffusion data, demonstrating the advantages of our method over existing
approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.08138v1

We show that by enhancing insulin-dependent glucose utilization by the tissues
in two phases, a rapid short-term increase in insulin-independent glucose
clearance and augmented glucose uptake, and a long-term sustained increase
sensitivity to insulin action, a metabolic model able to reproduce the effects
of activity on glucose disposal is obtained. Second, a control-oriented
transfer function model is proposed to predict the BG response to an exercise
bout modeled as a step change in heart rate (HR). Results comparing model

binomial-response generalized linear models, and in logistic regression, in
particular, are supported by the results of Kosmidis and Firth (2021,
Biometrika), who show that the resulting estimates are also always
finite-valued, even in cases where the maximum likelihood estimates are not,
which is a practical issue regardless of the size of the data set. In logistic
regression, the implied adjusted score equations are formally bias-reducing in
asymptotic frameworks with a fixed number of parameters and appear to deliver a
substantial reduction in the persistent bias of the maximum likelihood
estimator in high-dimensional settings where the number of parameters grows
asymptotically linearly and slower than the number of observations. In this
work, we develop and present two new variants of iteratively reweighted least
squares for estimating generalized linear models with adjusted score equations
for mean bias reduction and maximization of the likelihood penalized by a
positive power of the Jeffreys-prior penalty, which eliminate the requirement
of storing $O(n)$ quantities in memory, and can operate with data sets that
exceed computer memory or even hard drive capacity. We achieve that through
incremental QR decompositions, which enable IWLS iterations to have access only
to data chunks of predetermined size. We assess the procedures through a
real-data application with millions of observations, and in high-dimensional
logistic regression, where a large-scale simulation experiment produces
concrete evidence for the existence of a simple adjustment to the maximum
Jeffreys'-penalized likelihood estimates that delivers high accuracy in terms
of signal recovery even in cases where estimates from ML and other
recently-proposed corrective methods do not exist.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.07342v2

Carlo simulations to evaluate the performance of this Bayesian approach. In
addition to parameter estimation, we evaluate the proposed approach to verify
the presence of unit roots in the model's systematic component and study prior

refer to overlapping sets of entities when there is no unique identifying
field. In streaming record linkage, files arrive sequentially in time and
estimates of links are updated after the arrival of each file. This problem
arises in settings such as longitudinal surveys, electronic health records, and
online events databases, among others. The challenge in streaming record
linkage is to efficiently update parameter estimates as new data arrives. We
approach the problem from a Bayesian perspective with estimates in the form of
posterior samples of parameters and present methods for updating link estimates
after the arrival of a new file that are faster than fitting a joint model with
each new data file. In this paper, we generalize a two-file Bayesian
Fellegi-Sunter model to the multi-file case and propose two methods to perform
streaming updates. We examine the effect of prior distribution on the resulting
linkage accuracy as well as the computational trade-offs between the methods

reliability of sampling, density evaluation, and evidence lower bound (ELBO)
estimation in variational flows. We first empirically demonstrate that common
flows can exhibit a catastrophic accumulation of error: the numerical flow map
deviates significantly from the exact map -- which affects sampling -- and the
numerical inverse flow map does not accurately recover the initial input --
which affects density and ELBO computations. Surprisingly though, we find that
results produced by flows are often accurate enough for applications despite
the presence of serious numerical instability. In this work, we treat
variational flows as dynamical systems, and leverage shadowing theory to
elucidate this behavior via theoretical guarantees on the error of sampling,
density evaluation, and ELBO estimation. Finally, we develop and empirically
test a diagnostic procedure that can be used to validate results produced by
numerically unstable flows in practice.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06957v1

``mean-field'', Gaussian distributions are often used as approximate
probability density functions in variational inference since the number of
variational parameters is twice the number of unknown model parameters. The
resulting diagonal covariance structure coupled with unimodal behavior can be
too restrictive when dealing with highly non-Gaussian behavior, including
multimodality. High-fidelity surrogate posteriors in the form of Gaussian
mixtures can capture any distribution to an arbitrary degree of accuracy while
maintaining some analytical tractability. Variational inference with Gaussian
mixtures with full-covariance structures suffers from a quadratic growth in
variational parameters with the number of model parameters. Coupled with the
existence of multiple local minima due to nonconvex trends in the loss
functions often associated with variational inference, these challenges
motivate the need for robust initialization procedures to improve the
performance and scalability of variational inference with mixture models.
  In this work, we propose a method for constructing an initial Gaussian
mixture model approximation that can be used to warm-start the iterative
solvers for variational inference. The procedure begins with an optimization
stage in model parameter space in which local gradient-based optimization,
globalized through multistart, is used to determine a set of local maxima,
which we take to approximate the mixture component centers. Around each mode, a
local Gaussian approximation is constructed via the Laplace method. Finally,
the mixture weights are determined through constrained least squares
regression. Robustness and scalability are demonstrated using synthetic tests.
The methodology is applied to an inversion problem in structural dynamics

or under-performing models. In this paper we present balance, an open-source
Python package by Meta, offering a simple workflow for analyzing and adjusting
biased data samples with respect to a population of interest.
  The balance workflow includes three steps: understanding the initial bias in
the data relative to a target we would like to infer, adjusting the data to
correct for the bias by producing weights for each unit in the sample based on
propensity scores, and evaluating the final biases and the variance inflation
after applying the fitted weights. The package provides a simple API that can

Traditional robust methods may not be feasible nor efficient in dealing with

cellwise outliers by minimising a regression loss and cell deviation measure
simultaneously. To evaluate the approach, we conduct empirical studies

Carlo (MC) method with importance sampling (IS) to estimate rare event
quantities expressed as an expectation of a smooth observable of solutions to a
broad class of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations. We extend the
double loop Monte Carlo (DLMC) estimator, previously introduced in our works
(Ben Rached et al., 2022a,b), to the multi-index setting. We formulate a new
multi-index DLMC estimator and conduct a comprehensive cost-error analysis,
leading to improved complexity results. To address rare events, an importance
sampling scheme is applied using stochastic optimal control of the single level
DLMC estimator. This combination of IS and multi-index DLMC not only reduces
computational complexity by two orders but also significantly decreases the
associated constant compared to vanilla MC. The effectiveness of the proposed
multi-index DLMC estimator is demonstrated using the Kuramoto model from
statistical physics. The results confirm a reduced complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TOL}_{\mathrm{r}}^{-4})$ for the single level DLMC
estimator (Ben Rached et al., 2022a) to
$\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TOL}_{\mathrm{r}}^{-2} (\log

inference and density estimation. Generative models, such as normalizing flows
and generative adversarial networks, characterize conditional distributions by
learning a transport map that pushes forward a simple reference (e.g., a
standard Gaussian) to a target distribution. While these approaches
successfully describe many non-Gaussian problems, their performance is often
limited by parametric bias and the reliability of gradient-based (adversarial)
optimizers to learn these transformations. This work proposes a non-parametric
generative model that iteratively maps reference samples to the target. The
model uses block-triangular transport maps, whose components are shown to
characterize conditionals of the target distribution. These maps arise from
solving an optimal transport problem with a weighted $L^2$ cost function,
thereby extending the data-driven approach in [Trigila and Tabak, 2016] for
conditional sampling. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a two

field is well-explored. The purpose of MCMC methods is to approximate a
distribution through repeated sampling; most MCMC algorithms exhibit
asymptotically optimal behavior in that they converge to the true distribution
at the limit. However, what differentiates these algorithms are their practical
convergence guarantees and efficiency. While a sampler may eventually
approximate a distribution well, because it is used in the real world it is
necessary that the point at which the sampler yields a good estimate of the
distribution is reachable in a reasonable amount of time. Similarly, if it is
computationally difficult or intractable to produce good samples from a
distribution for use in estimation, then there is no real-world utility
afforded by the sampler. Thus, most MCMC methods these days focus on improving
efficiency and speeding up convergence. However, many MCMC algorithms suffer
from random walk behavior and often only mitigate such behavior as outright
erasing random walks is difficult. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a class of
MCMC methods that theoretically exhibit no random walk behavior because of
properties related to Hamiltonian dynamics. This paper introduces modifications
to a specific HMC algorithm known as the no-U-turn sampler (NUTS) that aims to
explore the sample space faster than NUTS, yielding a sampler that has faster
convergence to the true distribution than NUTS.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06279v1

properties.
  In this paper, we show that the set of all optimal approximate designs often
corresponds to a polytope. The polytope can be fully represented by the set of
its vertices, which we call vertex optimal designs. We prove that these optimal
designs possess unique characteristics, such as small supports, and suggest
their potential applications. We also demonstrate that for a variety of models,

precisely, we consider a general class of MCMC algorithms we call dynamic HMC.
We show that this general framework encompasses NUTS as a particular case,
implying the invariance of the target distribution as a by-product. Second, we
establish conditions under which NUTS is irreducible and aperiodic and as a
corrolary ergodic. Under conditions similar to the ones existing for HMC, we
also show that NUTS is geometrically ergodic. Finally, we improve existing

Extensive research exists on state-space models (SSMs), which are powerful
mathematical tools that allow for probabilistic and interpretable learning on
time series. Estimating the model parameters in SSMs is arguably one of the
most complicated tasks, and the inclusion of prior knowledge is known to both
ease the interpretation but also to complicate the inferential tasks. Very
recent works have attempted to incorporate a graphical perspective on some of
those model parameters, but they present notable limitations that this work
addresses. More generally, existing graphical modeling tools are designed to
incorporate either static information, focusing on statistical dependencies
among independent random variables (e.g., graphical Lasso approach), or dynamic
information, emphasizing causal relationships among time series samples (e.g.,
graphical Granger approaches). However, there are no joint approaches combining
static and dynamic graphical modeling within the context of SSMs. This work
proposes a novel approach to fill this gap by introducing a joint graphical
modeling framework that bridges the static graphical Lasso model and a
causal-based graphical approach for the linear-Gaussian SSM. We present DGLASSO
(Dynamic Graphical Lasso), a new inference method within this framework that
